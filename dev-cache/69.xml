<h2 id="evolution-not-revolution">Evolution, not Revolution</h2>

<p>If it’s still a mystery to you what a Large Language Model does, in one hour you can understand it better than almost 
everyone else out there. Andrej Karpathy (formerly of OpenAI) does an excellent lay-person-friendly explanation of how this 
technology works, its advantages, issues, and where the future may lead:</p>

<div class="video">

</div>

<p>As you can see, a neural network is simply an impressive statistical autocomplete, a very smart Hadoop. This is the 
next iteration of Big Data, and a great one at that. Maybe we can even call it a “leap”, but any claims that this new 
technology will be completely transforming our daily lives soon should be taken with a two-ton boulder of salt.</p>

<p>The Internet was truly a transformative invention since it was a completely new medium. It changed the way we read,
communicate, watch, listen, shop, work. Being able to ask a search engine a question and get a good answer is hardly earth-shattering. 
It’s basically expected.</p>

<p>Maybe we can use a more appropriate term? How about <strong>Big Data 2.0</strong>?</p>

<p>It’s easy to get the impression that AI is <em>everywhere</em>, as the term is being
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/03/what-is-artificial-intelligence/518547/" target="_blank">overused to death</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AI has also become a fashion for corporate strategy. The Bloomberg Intelligence economist Michael McDonough tracked 
mentions of “artificial intelligence” in earnings call transcripts, noting a huge uptick in the last two years. 
Companies boast about undefined AI acquisitions. The 2017 Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends report claims that
AI has “revolutionized” the way people work and live, but never cites specifics. Nevertheless, coverage of the report 
concludes that artificial intelligence is forcing corporate leaders to “reconsider some of their core structures.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Big Data 2.0 is not as useless to the rest of us as, say, blockchains, but the surrounding hype has a distinct whiff of Web 3.0. 
The technology is supposed to change everything, but 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwyp0wogOrw" target="_blank">no one has any good details</a>.</p>

<p>Right now, however, it’s often hard to separate signal from noise, to tell the difference between true AI-driven breakthroughs and
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/machine-learning-helps-gm-pick-the-best-places-to-put-new-ev-fast-chargers" target="_blank">things that have been possible for a long time with a calculator</a>. 
Enterprises are backing the money truck up and dumping it all into R&amp;D projects without a specific goal. 
More than half do not even have a use case in mind, and 
<a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2024/04/17/if-everyone-is-building-ai-why-aren-t-more-projects-in-production/" target="_blank">at least 90% of these boondoggles never see the light of day</a>.</p>

<p>We’ve been here before. Here is how <em>Harvard Business Review</em> described
<a href="https://hbr.org/2013/12/you-may-not-need-big-data-after-all" target="_blank">Big Data FOMO</a>
over 10 years ago:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The biggest reason that investments in big data fail to pay off, though, is that most companies don’t do a good job 
with the information they already have. They don’t know how to manage it, analyze it in ways that enhance their 
understanding, and then make changes in response to new insights. Companies don’t magically develop those 
competencies just because they’ve invested in high-end analytics tools. They first need to learn how to 
use the data already embedded in their core operating systems, much the way people must master 
arithmetic before they tackle algebra. Until a company learns how to use data and analysis to support its operating 
decisions, it will not be in a position to benefit from big data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Replace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">big data</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">artificial intelligence</code>, and … you get the point.</p>

<h2 id="the-word-intelligence-is-doing-a-lot-of-work">The word “Intelligence” is doing a lot of work</h2>

<p>“Intelligence” is just a very problematic term, and it is getting everyone thoroughly confused.</p>

<p>It’s easy to ferret out AI hype soldiers by just claiming that LLMs are not <strong>real</strong> intelligence. “But human brains are a 
learning machine! They also take in information and generate output, you rube!”</p>

<p>When we open this giant can of worms, we get into some tricky philosophical questions, such as “what does it mean to reason, 
to have a mental model of the world, to feel, to be curious?”</p>

<photo-element source="skynet/llm.png" aspect="original-size" alt="" credit="How an LLM makes a decision"></photo-element>

<p>We do not have any good definition for what “intelligence” is, and the existing tests seem to be failing. 
You can imagine how disorienting all of this is to bystanders when even the experts working in the field are 
<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/artificial-general-intelligence-is-a-rorschach-test-do-we-need-orangutans/" target="_blank">less than clear about it</a>. 
The Turing Test 
<a href="https://www.wildfirepr.com/blog/can-ai-really-pass-the-turing-test/#:~:text=During%20a%20live%20demonstration%20at,the%20jury%20of%20its%20humanity" target="_blank">has been conquered</a> 
by computers. What’s next? The Blade Runner empathy test?</p>

<div class="video">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cIFMwObyst4?si=oHymxRM1lLKhZL8l" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; 
        picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="">
    </iframe>
</div>

<p>It’s likely that many actual humans will fail this kind of questioning, considering that we seem to be 
<a href="https://time.com/6099906/rude-customers-pandemic/" target="_blank">leaking humility</a>
as a species. <em>Tortoise in the sun, you say? The price of eggs is too high - f**k the tortoise!</em></p>

<p>Five years ago, most of us would have probably claimed that 
<a href="https://youtu.be/Wy4EfdnMZ5g?si=Pnz68LQRKoLfC4VP" target="_blank">HAL from Space Odyssey 2000</a>
was true general artificial intelligence. Now we know that a chatbot can easily have a very convincing “personality”
that is deceptively human-like. It will even claim it has feelings.</p>

<p>The head of AI research at Meta has been <em>repeatedly</em> wrong about ChatGPT’s ability to solve complex object interactions.
The more data a general AI model is trained on, the better it gets, it seems.</p>

<photo-element source="skynet/wrong.png" aspect="landscape"></photo-element>

<p>The scaling effect of training data will make general-knowledge AI nail the answer more often, but we will always find a 
way to trip it up. The model simply does not have enough training data to answer something esoteric for which
there is little to none available training data required to make the connection.</p>

<p>So, what does it mean to make a decision? An IF-ELSE programming statement makes decisions — is it intelligent? 
What about an NPC video game opponent? It “sees” the world, it can navigate obstacles, it can figure out my future location
based on speed and direction. Is it intelligent? What if we add deep learning capabilities to the computer opponent, so 
it could anticipate my moves before I even make them? Am I playing against intelligence <em>now</em>?</p>

<photo-element source="skynet/opinion.gif" aspect="original-size"></photo-element>

<p>We know how LLMs work, but understanding how humans store the model of the world and how “meat computers” process information 
so quickly is basically a mystery. Here, we enter a universe of infinite variables. Our decision vector will change 
based on the time of day, ambient room temperature, hormones, and a billion other things. Do we really want to go there?</p>

<p>The definition of “intelligence” is a moving target. Where does 
<a href="https://corecursive.com/eliza-with-jeff-shrager/" target="_blank">a very good computer program</a> stop and intelligence begins? We don’t
know where the line is or whether it even exists.</p>

<h2 id="misinformation--is-this-going-to-be-a-problem">Misinformation — is this going to be a problem?</h2>

<p>Years before OpenAI’s SORA came out, the MIT Center of Advanced Virtual Reality created one of the first convincing deep fake 
videos, with 
<a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/mit-tackles-misinformation-in-event-of-moon-disaster-0720" target="_blank">Richard Nixon delivering a speech after the first moon landing failed</a>.
The written speech was real, the video was not.</p>

<p>And now this 
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/02/openai-sora-generated-video-fake/677493/" target="_blank">reality is here in high definition</a>. 
A group of high-tech scammers use deep fake video personas to 
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/deepfake-scammer-walks-off-with-25-million-in-first-of-its-kind-ai-heist/" target="_blank">convince the CFO of a company to transfer out $25 million dollars</a>. 
Parents 
<a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/tech/ai-clone-child-voice-kidnapping-scam-us-b1088043.html" target="_blank">receive extortion phone calls</a>
with their own AI “children” on the phone as proof-of-life. Voters get 
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/deepfake-politician-biden-what-matters/index.html" target="_blank">realistic AI-generated robocalls</a>.</p>

<p>Will this change our daily lives? Doubtful. New day, new technology, new class of fraud. Some fell for that 
<a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/pig-butchering-scam-18493673.php" target="_blank">“wrong number” crypto scam</a>,
but most of us have learned to recognize and ignore it. In the spirit of progress, the scam is

The game of cat and mouse continues, the world keeps spinning, and we all lose a little more.</p>

<p>What about the bigger question of misinformation? What will it do to our politics? Our mental health? It would be reckless 
to make a prediction, but I am less worried than others. There are literally tens of millions of people who believe in
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2023/07/15/the-adrenochrome-conspiracy-theory-pushed-by-sound-of-freedom-star-explained/?sh=607b66985179" target="_blank">bonkers QAnon conspiracy theories</a>.
Those who are convinced that all of this is true need no additional “proof”.</p>

<p>Sure, there will be a wider net cast that drags in the less prudent. The path from radicalization to violence based on 
fake information will become shorter, but it will all come down to people’s choice of media consumption diets — as it always has been the case. 
Do we choose to get our news from professional journalists with actual jobs, faces, and names, or are we “doing our own research” 
by reading the feed from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@Total_Truth_Teller3000</code>?</p>

<p>From <a href="https://pxlnv.com/blog/fake-it-til-you-fake-it/" target="_blank">Fake It ‘Til You Fake It</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We put our trust in people to help us evaluate information. Even people who have no faith in institutions and experts 
have something they see as reputable, regardless of whether it actually is. Generative tools only add to the existing 
inundation of questionably sourced media. Something feels different about them, but I am not entirely sure anything is 
actually different. We still need to skeptically — but not cynically — evaluate everything we see.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In fact, what if we are actually surprised by the outcome? What if, exhausted by the firehose of nonsense and AI-generated garbage
on the internet, we reverse this hell cart and move back closer to the roots? Quality, human-curated content, 
newsletters, professional media. Will we see another Yahoo-like Internet directory? Please sign my guestbook.</p>

<h2 id="artificial-intelligence-is-dangerous">“Artificial intelligence is dangerous”</h2>

<p>Microsoft had to “lobotomize” its AI bot personality - Sydney - after it tried to convince tech reporter Casey Newton that
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/17/podcasts/hard-fork-bing-ai-elon.html" target="_blank">his spouse didn’t really love him</a>:</p>

<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/23/business/google-ai-engineer-fired-sentient/index.html" target="_blank">was fired for causing a ruckus</a>. 
It wouldn’t be shocking if they had seen anything close to this (also “Sydney”):</p>

<p>One can read this and immediately open a new tab to start shopping for Judgment Day supplies.</p>

<p>AI is “dangerous” in the same way a bulldozer without a driver is dangerous. 
The bulldozer is not responsible for the damage — the reckless operator is. It’s our responsibility as humans to make 
sure layers of checks and due diligence are in place before we wire AI to potent systems. This is not exactly new. 
Let’s be clear, no one is about to connect a Reddit-driven GPT to a weapon and let it rip.</p>

<p>These systems are not proactive — they won’t do anything unless we ask them to, and an LLM is certainly not quietly 
contemplating the fastest path to our demise while in its idle state. There is also this nonsensical idea that is 
being propagated by some that there is a certain critical mass at which a Large Language Model becomes sentient and
then its lights out of humanity. <em>This is not how any of this works</em>.</p>

<p>Prof. Emily M. Bender maintains
<a href="https://medium.com/@emilymenonbender/aihype-take-downs-5c6fcc5c5ba1" target="_blank">AI Hype Take-Downs</a>,
stomping out the media’s breathless reporting of the inevitable invasion of AGI cyborgs.
She writes <a href="https://medium.com/@emilymenonbender/on-nyt-magazine-on-ai-resist-the-urge-to-be-impressed-3d92fd9a0edd" target="_blank">in one of them</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Puff pieces that fawn over what Silicon Valley techbros have done, with amassed capital and computing power, 
are not helping us get any closer to solutions to problems created by the deployment of so-called “AI”. 
On the contrary, they make it harder by refocusing attention on strawman problems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, take Signal’s director Meredith Whittaker, who 
<a href="https://app.podscribe.ai/episode/99710918" target="_blank">pointed out to Chris Hayes</a> what many are seeing,
a marketing and branding tactic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Techniques that were developed in the late 1980s could do new things when you had, compute, huge amounts of compute, and 
huge amounts of data. So it was basically favoring an industry that had already sort of consolidated many of these 
resources in a way that had no real competition. And I think it’s really notable that when this came out, we weren’t 
really talking about AI, we were talking about machine learning, we were talking about neural networks.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We were using kind of technical terms of art, but the AI narrative was kind of bolted onto that with the super-intelligence, 
with this idea of building an AGI, which I find to be a really powerful marketing narrative.
If what you want to do is sell the derivative outputs of your kind of surveillance business model. These 
models created by the data and the compute as intelligent, as capable of solving problems across a billion d different markets 
from education to healthcare to whatever. So I think we need to trace also the history of that term “AI”, and 
particularly like how it became favored now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The warnings that you hear about AI may be misguided at best. At worst, it’s a diversion, an
argument not done in good faith. “Dangerous technology” is “powerful technology”. Powerful technology is
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/09/openai-ceo-sam-altman-reportedly-seeking-trillions-of-dollars-for-ai-chip-project.html" target="_blank">valuable</a>. The actual dangers are boring. Confronting these requires technical curiosity, 
wonkiness, and regulatory consumer protection drudgery — not construction of 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA_mmhQOjdg" target="_blank">fiery moats</a> 
 to fend off the coming tech apocalypse.</p>

<h2 id="prepare-for-mixed-results">Prepare for mixed results</h2>

<p>Once the 
<a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2024/02/13/the-creator-of-pytorch-lightning-on-the-ai-hype-cycle/" target="_blank">AI hype cycle</a>
fog clears and the novelty wears off, the new reality may look quite boring. Our AI overlords are not going to show
up, and AI is not going to start magically performing all of our jobs. We were promised flying cars, and all that we
might get instead will be better product descriptions on Etsy and automated 
article summaries, making sure of the fact that we still don’t really <em>read</em> anything longer than a tweet. And, yes,
a LOT of useless,

<p>Many have found more reasonable, sustainable uses for the general-purpose chatbots: 
categorization, summaries, grammar checks, idea lists. 
In the next few model generations, however, the price of model training will not be in the hundreds of millions of dollars — it will be in <em>billions</em>.
Can such atrocious costs justify a paragraph-rephraser?</p>

<p>Specialized Big Data 2.0 will hum along in the background, performing its narrow-scope work in various fields, 
possibly with varying successes and ROIs:</p>

<photo-element source="skynet/office.jpeg" aspect="landscape"></photo-element>

<p>There is also the issue of general-purpose vs. specialized AI, as the former seems to often be the source
of
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/chatgpt-and-google-gemini-are-both-doomed.html" target="_blank">fresh PR dumpster fires</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Specialized AI represents real products and an aggregate situation in which questions about AI bias, training data, 
and ideology at least feel less salient to customers and users. The “characters” performed by scoped, purpose-built 
AI are performing joblike roles with employeelike personae. They don’t need to have an opinion on Hitler or Elon Musk 
because the customers aren’t looking for one, and the bosses won’t let it have one, and that makes perfect sense to 
everyone in the contexts in which they’re being deployed. They’re expected to be careful about what they say and to avoid 
subjects that aren’t germane to the task for which they’ve been “hired.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In contrast, general-purpose public chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini are practically begging to be asked about Hitler. 
After all, they’re open text boxes on the internet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And even with the more narrow-scope uses, just jumping on the bandwagon 
<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/car-dealership-chevrolet-chatbot-chatgpt-pranks-chevy-2023-12" target="_blank">can easily go sideways</a>:</p>

<p>Do you ever wonder why the special effects in Terminator 2 look better than modern CGI, a shocking 35 years later?</p>

<p>One word — <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CViWXcMlJrM/" target="_blank">craft</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Winston and his crew spent weeks shooting pellets into mud, studying the patterns made by the impact, then duplicating 
them in sculpted form and producing appliances. Vacumetalizing slip rubber latex material, backed with soft foam 
rubber or polyfoam, achieved the chrome look. The splash appliances were sculpted and produced in a variety of patterns 
and sizes and were fitted with an irising, petal-like spring-loaded mechanism that would open the bullet wounds on cue. 
This flowering mechanism was attached to a fiberglass chest plate worn by Robert Patrick.</p>
</blockquote>

<photo-element source="skynet/t2.png" aspect="original-size"></photo-element>

<p>And <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2015/06/oral-history-of-emt2ems-liquid-metal-effect.html" target="_blank">this striking quote</a> 
from the film’s effects supervisor:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The computer is another tool, and in the end, it’s how you use a tool, particularly when it comes to artistic choices. 
What the computer did, just like what’s happened all through our industry, it has de-skilled most of the folks that 
now work in visual effects in the computer world. That’s why half of the movies you watch, these big ones that are 
effects-driven, look like cartoons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>De-skilled. <strong>De-skilled</strong>.</p>

<p>Or take, for example, digital photography. It undoubtedly made taking pictures easier, ballooning the number of images
taken to stratospheric levels. Has the art of photography become better, though? There was something different
about it in the days before we all started mindlessly pressing that camera button on our smartphones. When every shot
counted, when you only had 36 tries that cost $10 per roll, you had to learn about light, focus, exposure, composition.
You were standing there, watching a scene unfold like a hawk, because there were five shots left in that roll and you could not miss that <em>moment</em>.</p>

<photo-element source="skynet/monkey.webp" aspect="landscape" credit="New York Magazine. Who Ate Where issue"></photo-element>

<p>Be it art or software, “productivity” at some point starts being “mediocrity.” Generative AI is going to be responsible
for churning out a lot more “work” and “art” at this point, but it is not going to grant you a way out of being <em>good</em> at 
what you do. In fact, it creates new, more subtle dangers to your skills, 
as this technology can make us believe that we are better than we actually are. 
Being <em>good</em> still requires work, time, attention to detail, trial, error, and tons of frustration.</p>

<p>And at the same time, It’s futile to try and stop the stubborn wheel of enshitification from turning. It’s becoming
easier to create content. Everyone is now a writer, everyone is an artist. The barrier of entry is getting closer to nil, 
but so is the quality of it all. And now it is <em>autogenerated</em>.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/26/opinion/ai-future-photography.html?smid=nytcore-android-share" target="_blank">A.I. Is the Future of Photography. Does That Mean Photography Is Dead?</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I entered photography right at that moment, when film photographers were going crazy because they did not want digital
photography to be called photography. They felt that if there was nothing hitting physical celluloid, it could not be 
called photography. I don’t know if it’s PTSD or just the weird feeling of having had similar, heated discussions almost 
20 years ago, but having lived through that and seeing that you can’t do anything about it once the technology is good enough, 
I’m thinking: Why even fight it? It’s here.</p>

<p>Jamie Zawinski is kind of a tech legend. He came up with the name “Mozilla”, invented that whole
thing where you can send HTML in emails, and more. In his harrowing work diary of how the
<a href="https://slate.com/technology/2014/10/netscape-navigator-browser-created-by-mosaic-communications-corporation-turns-20.html" target="_blank">Mosaic web browser</a>
came to be, Jamie 
<a href="https://www.jwz.org/gruntle/nscpdorm.html" target="_blank">described</a> 
the burnout rodeo that was the development of what was later going to become Netscape (the top disclaimer has its own history — ignore it):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I slept at work again last night; two and a half hours curled up in a quilt underneath my desk, from 11am to 1:30pm or so. 
That was when I woke up with a start, realizing that I was late for a meeting we were scheduled to have to argue about 
colormaps and dithering, and how we should deal with all the nefarious 8-bit color management issues. 
But it was no big deal, we just had the meeting later. It’s hard for someone to hold it against you when you miss 
a meeting because you’ve been at work so long that you’ve passed out from exhaustion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Netscape’s wild ride is well-depicted in the dramatized Discovery miniseries
<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/tv/shows/valley-of-the-boom/episode-guide/season-01/episode-01-part-1-print-hello-world/vdka10919537" target="_blank">Valley of the Boom</a>,
and the company eventually collapsed with the 
death march rewrite of what seemed to be just seriously unmaintainable code. It was the subject of one of the more 
famous articles by ex-Microsoft engineer-turned-entrepreneur Joel Spolsky -
<a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/" target="_blank">Things You Should Never Do</a>.</p>

<p>There have been big, successful rewrites. Twitter moved away from Ruby-on-Rails to JVM over a decade ago but the first, 
year-long full rewrite effort completely failed. Following architecture by fiat from the top, the engineering team said
nothing, speaking out only days before the launch. The whole thing would crash out of the gate, they claimed, so Twitter 
had to go back to the drawing board and rewrite <em>again</em>.</p>

<div class="sidebar">
I cannot cite any information on the web about this story. It was told at a Meetup I myself attended years ago, at Etsy's DUMBO offices, 
by *the* manager who oversaw the failed rewrite effort. He acknowledged his mistake and because of such candor 
was able to keep his job. The mistake was - of course - thinking that he knew better than the engineers who were down
in the trenches.
</div>

<p>What didn’t work for Netscape worked for Twitter. Why? Netscape had major heat coming from ruthless Microsoft competition, 
very little time for major moves, and a team aleady
exhausted from “office heroics”. Twitter, however, is a unique product that 
is incredibly hard to dislodge, even with the almost purposefully

It’s hard to abandon your social media account after accumulating algorithmic reputation and followers for years, 
and yet one can switch browsers faster than they can switch socks. Companies often do not survive this kind of adventure 
without having an almost unfair

<h3 id="the-road-to-hell-is-paved-with-todo-comments">The road to hell is paved with TODO comments</h3>

<p>All of this is to say that you should probably never let your system rot so badly until a code rewrite is even in the cards. 
It never just happens. Your code doesn’t just become unmaintainable overnight. It gets there by the constant cutting of corners,
hard-coding things, and crop-dusting your work with long-forgotten <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">//FIXME</code> comments. Fix who?</p>

<p>We used to call it technical debt - a term that is 
<a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/12/27/stop-saying-technical-debt/" target="_blank">now being frowned upon</a>.
The concept of “technical debt” got popular
around the time when we were getting obsessed with “proh-cess” and Agile, as we got tired of death march projects, 
arbitrary deadlines, and general lack of structure and visibility into our work. Every software project felt like a 
tour — you came up for air and then went back into the 💩 for months.</p>

<p>Agile meant that the stakeholders could be present in our planning meetings. We had to explain to them - somehow -
that it took time to upgrade the web framework from v1 to v5 because no one has been using v1 for years, and in general,
it slowed everyone down. Since we didn’t know how to explain this to a non-coder, someone came up with the condescending term 
“technical debt” — “those spreadsheet monkeys wouldn’t understand what we do here!”</p>

<p>While the term has most likely run its course as a manipulative verbal device, it is absolutely the right term 
to use amongst ourselves to reason about risks and to properly triage them.</p>

<h3 id="the-three-type-of-technical-debt">The three type of technical debt</h3>

<p>The word “debt” has negative connotations for sure, but just like with actual monetary debt, it’s never great but not 
always horrible. To mutilate the famous saying - you have to spend code to make code. I would categorize technical debt into three types — <strong>Aesthetic</strong>, 
<strong>Deferrable</strong>, and <strong>Toxic</strong>. A mark of a good engineer is knowing when to create technical debt, what kind of debt,
and when to repay it.</p>

<h4 id="aesthetic-debt">Aesthetic debt</h4>

<p>This is the kind of stuff that triggers your OCD but does not really affect your users or your velocity 
in any way. Maybe the import sort order is an eyesore, or maybe there is a naming convention that is 
grinding your gears. It’s something that can be addressed with relatively low effort when you are good and ready, in 
many cases with proper automated code analysis and tools.</p>

<h4 id="deferrable-debt">Deferrable debt</h4>

<p>Deferrable debt is what should be refactored at some point, but it’s fairly contained and will not be 
a problem in the immediate future. The kind of debt that you need to minimize by methodically crossing it off your list, 
and as long as it seeps through into your sprint work, you can probably avoid a scenario where it all gets out of control.</p>

<p>Sometimes this sort of thing is really contained - a lone hacky file, written in the Mesozoic Era by a sleep-deprived 
Jamie Zawinski because someone was breathing down his neck. No one really understands what the code does, but it’s been 
humming along for the last 7 years, so why take your chances by waking the sleeping dragons? Slap the 
<a href="https://gist.github.com/crittelmeyer/b4c8ec6f02c024798ccb" target="_blank">Safety Pig</a> on it, claim a victory,
and go shake down a vending machine.</p>

<photo-element source="debt/safetypig.webp" aspect="landscape" alt=""></photo-element>

<h4 id="toxic-debt">Toxic debt</h4>

<p>This is the kind of debt that needs to be addressed before it’s too late. How do you identify “toxic” debt? It’s that thing
that you did half-way and now it’s become a workaround magnet. “We have to do it like this now until we fix it - someday”.
The workarounds then become the foundation of new features, creating new and exciting debugging side quests. The future work required grows bigger with 
every new feature and a line of code. This is the toxic debt.</p>

<div class="sidebar">
This kind of baggage is extremely hard to get rid of once a feature or a product starts serving actual users. Other
things take priority, and the process of mitigating this debt in general becomes more involved and time-consuming. 
The risk of downtime or botched data migrations is just not there until it all gets real. The goal should be to have
as little toxic debt 
as possible before flipping the switch to ON.
</div>

<h3 id="lack-of-tests-is-toxic-debt">Lack of tests is toxic debt</h3>

<p>Not having automated tests, or insufficient testing of critical paths, is tech debt in its own right. 
The more untested code you are adding, the more miserable your life is going to get over time. Tests are important to fight 
the debt itself. It’s much easier to take a sledgehammer to your codebase when
a solid integration test suite’s got your back. We don’t like it, it’s upfront work that slows us down, but at some point
after your Minimal Viable Prototype starts running away from you, you need to switch into Test Mode and tie it all down — 
before things get really nasty.</p>

<h3 id="lack-of-documentation-is-toxic-debt">Lack of documentation is toxic debt</h3>

<p>I am not talking about a War &amp; Peace sized manual or detailed and severely out of date architecture diagrams in your 
Google Docs. Just a set of critical READMEs and runbooks on how to start the system locally and perform basic tasks. What variables and 
secrets do I need? What else do I need installed? If there is a bug report, how do I configure my local environment 
to reproduce it, and so on.</p>

<p>The time taken to reverse-engineer a system every time has an 
actual dollar value attached to it, plus the opportunity cost of not doing <em>useful work</em>.</p>

<h3 id="put-it-in-a-card">Put. It. In. A. Card.</h3>

<p>I love creating TODOs. They are easy to add without breaking the flow, and they are configured 
in my IDE to be bright and loud. It’s a TODO — I will do it someday. During the Annual TODO Week, obviously.
Let’s be frank — marking items as “TODO” is saying to yourself that you should really do this thing, but
probably never will.</p>

<p>This is relevant because TODO items can represent any level of technical debt described above, and so you should really 
make these actual stories on your Kanban/Agile boards.</p>

<h3 id="mark-technical-debt-as-such">Mark technical debt as such</h3>

<p>You should be able to easily scan your “debt stories” and figure out which ones have payment due. This can be either a 
tag in your issue-tracking system or a column in your Kanban-style board like Trello. An approach like this will let you
gauge better the ratio of new feature stories vs the growing technical debt. Your debt column will never be empty —
that goal is as futile as 
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/technology/personaltech/hey-email-service-screening.html" target="_blank">Zero Inbox</a>, 
but it should never grow out of control either.</p>

<p><a href="https://friendlyfire.tech" target="_blank">Friendly Fire</a> needs to periodically execute scheduled jobs - to remind Slack 
users to review GitHub pull requests. Instead of bolting on a new system just for this, I 
decided to leverage Postgres instead.</p>

<p>The must-have requirement was the ability to schedule a job to run in the future, with workers polling for “ripe” jobs, 
executing them and retrying on failure, with exponential backoff. With <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SKIP LOCKED</code>, Postgres has the needed functionality, 
allowing a single worker to atomically pull a job from the job queue without another worker pulling the same one.</p>

<p>This project is a demo of this system, slightly simplified.</p>

<photo-element source="jobq/screen.png" aspect="original-size" alt=""></photo-element>

<p>This example, 
<a href="https://github.com/papito/postgres-job-queue" target="_blank">available on GitHub</a> is a playground for the following:</p>

  <li>How to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Make</code> to simplify local commands</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="alter-mode-skip-complexity">ALTER MODE SKIP COMPLEXITY</h3>
<p>Postgres introduced <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SKIP LOCKED</code> years ago, but recently there was a 
noticeable uptick in the interest around this feature. In particular regarding its obvious use for 
<a href="https://adriano.fyi/posts/2023-09-24-choose-postgres-queue-technology/" target="_blank">simpler queuing systems</a>,
allowing us to bypass libraries or 
<a href="https://www.prequel.co/blog/sql-maxis-why-we-ditched-rabbitmq-and-replaced-it-with-a-postgres-queue" target="_blank">maintenance-hungry  third-party messaging systems</a>.</p>

<p>Why now? It’s hard to say, but my guess is that the tech sector is adjusting to the leaner times, looking for more efficient and 
cheaper ways of achieving the same goals at common-scale
but with fewer resources. Or shall we say - reasonable resources.</p>

<photo-element source="jobq/so-hot-rn.jpg" aspect="original-size" alt=""></photo-element>

<h3 id="whats-quart">What’s Quart?</h3>

<p>Quart is the asynchronous version of Flask. If you know about the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">g</code> - the global request context - you will be right at home. 
Multiple quality frameworks have entered Python-scape in recent years - <em>FastAPI</em>, <em>Sanic</em>, <em>Falcon</em>, <em>Litestar</em>. There is also <em>Bottle</em> 
and <em>Carafe</em>. Apparently naming Python frameworks after liquid containers is now a running joke.</p>

<p>Seeing that both Flask 
and Quart are now <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/" target="_blank">part of the Pallets project</a>, Quart has been curiously devoid 
of hype. These two are in the process of being merged and at some point will become one framework - classic 
synchronous Flask and 
asynchronous Quart in one.</p>

<h3 id="how-it-works">How it works</h3>

<p>Writing about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SKIP LOCKED</code> is going to be redundant as this has been covered plenty elsewhere. For example,
<a href="https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/what-is-select-skip-locked-for-in-postgresql-9-5" target="_blank">in this article</a>. 
Even more in-depth are <a href="https://www.pgcon.org/2016/schedule/track/Applications/929.en.html" target="_blank">these slides from 2016 PGCON</a>.</p>

<p>The central query looks like this:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">DELETE</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">job</span>
  <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">id</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span>
         <span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">id</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">job</span>
          <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">ripe_at</span> 
             <span class="k">IS</span> <span class="k">NULL</span> 
             <span class="k">OR</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="k">current_time</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="n">ripe_at</span>
     <span class="k">FOR</span> <span class="k">UPDATE</span>
    <span class="n">SKIP</span> <span class="n">LOCKED</span> <span class="k">LIMIT</span> <span class="mi">1</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each worker is 
<a href="https://github.com/papito/postgres-job-queue/blob/ecb829c975b83ebbc531a283313c96582966709a/jobq/service/job_worker_service.py#L19" target="_blank">added as a background task</a>,
periodically
<a href="https://github.com/papito/postgres-job-queue/blob/ecb829c975b83ebbc531a283313c96582966709a/jobq/job_worker.py#L79" target="_blank">querying the database</a>
for “ripe” jobs (the ones ready to execute), and then

<p>A job that does not have the “ripe” time set will be executed whenever a worker is available.</p>

<p>A job that fails will be retried with exponential backoff, up to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Job.max_retries</code> times:</p>

<p>Creating a job is simple:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">job</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Job</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Job</span><span class="p">(</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SKIP LOCKED</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DELETE ... SELECT FOR UPDATE</code> tango together to make sure that no worker gets the same job at the same time.
To keep things interesting, at the Postgres level we have an 
<a href="https://github.com/papito/postgres-job-queue/blob/ecb829c975b83ebbc531a283313c96582966709a/jobq/schema.sql#L8" target="_blank">MD5-based auto-generated</a> 
column to make sure that no job of the same type and with the same arguments gets queued up more than once.</p>

<p>This project also demonstrates the usage of

<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>

<p>The test suite leverages <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase</code> (Python 3.8 and up) to grant us access to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">asyncSetUp()</code> - this 
way we can call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">await</code> in our test setup functions:</p>

<p>Note that we set up the database only once for our test class. At the end of each test,
the connection is rolled back, returning the database to its pristine state for the next test. This is a speed trick to make sure
we don’t have to run
database setup code each single time. In this case it doesn’t really matter, but in a test suite large enough, this is going to
add up.</p>

<p>For delayed jobs, we simulate the future by freezing the clock at a specific time (relative to <strong>now</strong>):</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="improvements">Improvements</h3>

<p><strong>Batching</strong> - pulling more than one job at once would add major dragonforce to this system. This is not part of the 
example as to not overcomplicate it. You just need to be careful and return the failed jobs back in the queue while deleting the 
completed ones. With enough workers, a system like this could really be capable of handling serious common-scale workloads.</p>

<p><strong>Server exit</strong> - there are less than trivial ways of interrupting worker sleep cycles. This could improve the experience of 
running the service locally. In its current form, you have to wait a few seconds until all worker loops get out of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sleep()</code> 
and read the STOP flag.</p>

<p>It’s 2006, and the New York Magazine digital team set out to create a new search experience for its Fashion Week portal. It was 
one of
those projects where technical feasibility was not even discussed with the tech team - a common occurrence back then. Agile was
still new, let alone in publishing. It was just a vision, a real friggin’ moonshot, and 10 to 12 weeks to develop 
the wireframed version of the product. There would be almost no time left for proper QA. Fashion Week does not start slowly but 
rather goes from zero to sixty in a blink.</p>

<p>The vision? Thousands of near-real-time fashion show images, each one with its sub-items categorized: “2006”, “bag”, “red”, “
leather”, and so on. A user will land on the search page and have 
the ability to “drill down” and narrow the results based on those properties. To make things <em>much</em> harder, all of these 
properties would come with exact counts.</p>

<p>The workflow was going to be intense. Photographers will courier their digital cartridges from downtown NYC to
our offices on Madison Avenue, where the images will be processed, tagged by interns, and then indexed every hour by our Perl
script, reading the tags from the embedded EXIF information. Failure to build the search product on our side would have collapsed
the entire ecosystem already in place, primed and ready to rumble.</p>

<div class="sidebar">
Fashion Week at NYMAG is a huge deal. Sort of like the holidays for game developers, it's a thick, unmovable deadline with all 
hands on deck. As an example of how real it could get, take the 2008 Lindsay Lohan issue. Our 
CTO and the systems administrator had a bet going on whether the on-prem router was going to withstand the punishment (there 
was no cloud, AWS was still in its fetal stage). Lohan and behold - the router graph went up and to the right, flat-lining at 
100%. The CTO lost the bet, and the sys admin was the new happy owner of a bottle of Blue Label.

<p>“Oh! Just use the facets in Solr, dude”. Yeah, not so fast - <em>dude</em>. In 2006 that kind of technology didn’t even exist yet. I sat
through multiple enterprise search engine demos, and none of the products (which cost a LOT of money) could do a deep
faceted search. We already had an Autonomy license and my first try proved that… it just couldn’t do it. It was supposed to be 
able to, but the counts were all wrong. Endeca (now owned by Oracle), 
<a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2006/03/31/endeca-unveils-the-endeca-information-access-platform-takes-aim/" target="_blank">came out of stealth</a>
when the design part of the project was already underway. Too new, too raw, too risky. The idea was just a little too 
ambitious for its time, especially for a tiny team in a non-tech company.</p>

<p>So here we were, a team of three, myself and two consultants, writing Perl for the indexing script, query-parsing logic, and
modeling the data - in MySQL 4. It was one of those projects where one single insurmountable technical risk would have sunk the
whole thing. I will cut the story short and spare you the excitement. We did it, and then we went out to celebrate at a karaoke
bar (where I got my very first work-stress-related severe hangover) 🤮</p>

<p>For someone who was in charge of the SQL model and queries, it was days and days of tuning those, timing every query and studying
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EXPLAIN</code> output to see what else I could do to squeeze another 50ms out of the database. In the end, it was a combination of trial and error, digging deep into MySQL server settings, and crafting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GROUP BY</code>
queries that would make you nauseous. The MySQL query analyzer was fidgety back then, and sometimes re-arranging the fields in the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SELECT</code> clause could change a query’s performance. Imagine if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SELECT field1, field2 FROM my_table</code> was faster than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SELECT 
field2, field1 FROM my_table</code>. Why would it do that? I have no idea to this day, and I don’t even want to know.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I lost examples of this work, but the 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070519214259/http://nymag.com/fashion/fashionshows/2007/spring/main/newyork/womenrunway/yigalazrouel/" target="_blank">Way Back Machine</a>
has proof of our final product.</p>

<p>The point here is - if you really know your database, you can do pretty crazy things with it, and with the modern generation of 
storage
technologies and beefier hardware, you don’t even need to push the limits - it should easily handle what I refer to as 
“common-scale”.</p>

<h3 id="the-fading-art-of-sql">The fading art of SQL</h3>

<p>In the past few years I have been noticing an unsettling trend - software engineers are eager to use exotic “planet-scale”
databases for pretty rudimentary problems, while at the same time not having a good grasp of the very powerful 
relational
database engine they are likely already using, let alone understanding the technology’s more advanced and useful capabilities. 
The SQL layer is buried so deep beneath libraries and too clever by a half ORMs that it all just becomes high-level 
code.</p>

<ul class="conversation">
    <li>Why is it slow?</li>
    <li>No idea - <a href="https://medium.com/@liranbrimer/nice-to-meet-you-mondaydb-architecture-6d201b41e660" target="_blank">let's add Cassandra to it!</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Modern hardware certainly allows us to go way up from the CPU into the higher abstraction layers, while it wasn’t 
that uncommon in the past to convert certain functions to assembly code in order to squeeze every bit of performance out of the 
processor. Now compute and storage is cheaper - it’s true - but abusing this abundance has trained us
laziness and complacency. Suddenly, that Cloud bill is a wee too high, and heavens knows how 
much energy the world is burning by just running billions of auto-generated “Squeel” queries every second against mammoth 
database instances.</p>

<p>The morning of my first job interview in 2004, I was on a subway train memorizing 
the nine levels of database normalization. Or is it five levels? I don’t remember, and It doesn’t even matter - no one will ever
ask you this now in a software engineer interview.</p>

<p>Just skimming through the table of contents of your database of choice, say the now 
<a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/when-did-postgres-become-cool" target="_blank">freshly in vogue Postgres</a>,
you will find an absolute treasure trove of features fit to handle everything but the most gruesome
planet-scale computer science problems. Petabyte-sized Postgres boxes, replicated, are effortlessly running now as you
are reading this.</p>

<p>The trick is to not expect your database or your ORM to read your mind. Speaking of…</p>

<h3 id="orms-are-not-magic">ORMs are not magic</h3>

<p>I was a new hire at an e-commerce outfit, and right off the bat I was thrown into fixing serious performance issues with the
company’s product catalog pages. Just a straight-forward, paginated grid of product images. How hard could it be? Believe it or
not - it be. The pages took over 10 seconds to load, sometimes longer, the database was struggling, and the solution was to “just
cache it”. One last datapoint - this was not a high-traffic site. The pages were dead-slow even if there was no traffic at all. 
That’s a
rotten sign that something is seriously off.</p>

<p>After looking a bit closer, I realized that I hit the motherlode - all top three major database and coding mistakes in one.</p>

<h4 id="-mistake-1-there-is-no-index">❌ Mistake #1: There is no index</h4>

<p>The column that was hit in every single mission-critical query had no index. None. After adding the much-needed index in
production, you could practically hear MySQL exhaling in relief. Still, the performance was not quite there yet, so I
had to dig deeper, now in the code.</p>

<h4 id="-mistake-2-assuming-each-orm-call-is-free">❌ Mistake #2: Assuming each ORM call is free</h4>

<p>Activating the query logs locally and reloading a product listing page, I see… 200, 300, 500 queries fired off just to load one
single page. What the shit? Turns out, this was the result of a classic ORM abuse of going through every record in a loop, to the 
effect of:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">product_id</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">product_ids</span><span class="p">:</span>
   <span class="n">product</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">my_orm</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">products</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">product_id</span><span class="p">)</span>
   <span class="n">products</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">product</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The high number of queries was also due the fact that some of this logic was <em>nested</em>. The obvious solution is to keep the 
number of queries in each request to a minimum, using ORM capabilities to join and combine the data into one single blob. 
This is what relational databases do - <em>it’s in the name</em>.</p>

<p>What is happening above is that each separate query needs to travel to the database,
<a href="https://postgrespro.com/blog/pgsql/5969262#:~:text=Any%20query%20can%20be%20executed,rows%20that%20match%20your%20query" target="_blank">get parsed, transformed, analyzed, planned, executed</a>,
and then travel back to the caller. It is one of 
the most expensive operations you can do, and ORMs will happily do the worst possible thing for you in terms of 
performance. How does that ORM call translate to SQL? If it’s not what you think it should be, is it an ORM limitation or are you 
just not using the 
right library call? Is it a particular flavor of non-ANSI vendor SQL that your choice of ORM has a tough time with?
Do you ultimately need to drop into raw SQL for this call but not the others? And so on.</p>

<photo-element source="database-skills/55.png" aspect="original-size" alt="Don't do this"></photo-element>

<h4 id="-mistake-3-pulling-in-the-world">❌ Mistake #3: Pulling in the world</h4>

<p>To make matters worse, the amount of data here was relatively small, but there were dozens and dozens of columns. What do ORMs 
usually do by default in order to make your life “easier”? They send the whole thing, all the columns, clogging your network 
pipes with the data that you don’t even need. It is a form of <em>toxic technical debt</em>, where the speed of development will 
eventually start eating into performance.</p>

<p>I spent hours within the same project hacking the dark corners of the Dango admin, overriding default ORM queries to be less 
“eager”. This led 
to a much better office-facing experience.</p>

<h3 id="performance-is-a-feature">Performance IS a feature</h3>

<p>Serious, mission-critical systems have been running on classic and boring relational databases for decades, serving thousands of
requests per second. These systems have become more advanced, more capable, and more relevant. They are wonders of computer 
science, one can claim. You would think that an ancient database like Postgres (in development since 1982) is in some kind of
legacy maintenance mode at this point, but the opposite is true. In fact, the work has been only accelerating, with the scale
and 
<a href="https://www.se-radio.net/2019/04/se-radio-episode-362-simon-riggs-on-advanced-features-of-postgresql/" target="_blank">features becoming pretty impressive</a>.
What took multiple queries just a few years ago now takes a single one.</p>

<p>Why is this significant? It has been known for a long time, 
<a href="https://www.conductor.com/academy/page-speed-resources/faq/amazon-page-speed-study/" target="_blank">as discovered by Amazon</a>, 
that every additional 100ms of a user waiting for a page to load loses a business money. We also know now that from a user’s 
perspective, 
<a href="https://designingforperformance.com/performance-is-ux/#:~:text=A%20delay%20of%20less%20than,start%20to%20mentally%20context-switch" target="_blank">the maximum target response time for a web page is around 100 milliseconds</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A delay of less than 100 milliseconds feels instant to a user, but a delay between 100 and 300 milliseconds is perceptible. 
A delay between 300 and 1,000 milliseconds makes the user feel like a machine is working, but if the delay is above 1,000 milliseconds, your user will likely start to mentally context-switch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The “just add more CPU and RAM if it’s slow” approach may have worked for a while, but 
<a href="https://venturebeat.com/data-infrastructure/the-shift-to-the-cloud-could-be-costing-businesses-more-than-its-saving/" target="_blank">many are finding out the hard way</a>
that this kind of laziness is not sustainable in a frugal business environment where costs <em>matter</em>.</p>

<h3 id="database-anti-patterns">Database anti-patterns</h3>

<p>Knowing what <strong>not</strong> to do is as important as knowing what <strong>to</strong> do. Some of the below mistakes are all too common:</p>

<h4 id="-anti-pattern-1-using-exotic-databases-for-the-wrong-reasons">❌ Anti-pattern #1. Using exotic databases for the wrong reasons</h4>

<p>Technologies like DynamoDB are designed to handle scale at which Postgres and MySQL begin to fail. This is achieved by
denormalizing, duplicating the data aggressively, where the database is not doing much real-time data manipulation or joining.
Your data is now modeled after how it is queried, not after how it is <em>related</em>. Regular relational concepts disintegrate at this 
insane level of scale. Needless to say, if you are resorting to this kind of storage for “common-scale” problems, you are already 
<a href="/2023/09/10/death-by-a-thousand-microservices.html" target="_blank">solving problems you don’t have</a>.</p>

<h4 id="-anti-pattern-2-caching-things-unnecessarily">❌ Anti-pattern #2. Caching things unnecessarily</h4>

<p>Caching is a necessary evil - <em>but it’s not always necessary</em>. There is an entire class of bugs and on-call issues that 
stem from stale cached data. Read-only database replicas are a classic architecture pattern that
is still very much not outdated, and it will buy you insane levels of performance before you have to worry about anything. It 
should 
not be a
surprise that mature relational databases already have query caching in place - it just
<a href="https://severalnines.com/blog/overview-caching-postgresql/" target="_blank">has to be tuned</a>
for your specific needs.</p>

<p>Cache invalidation is hard. It adds more complexity and states of
uncertainty to your system. It makes debugging more difficult. I received more emails from content teams than I care for
throughout my career that wondered “why is the data not there, I updated it 30 minutes ago?!”</p>

<p><em>Caching should not act as a bandaid for bad architecture and non-performant code.</em></p>

<photo-element source="database-skills/two-problems.png" aspect="original-size" alt="Caching"></photo-element>

<h4 id="-anti-pattern-3-storing-everything-and-a-kitchen-sink">❌ Anti-pattern #3. Storing everything and a kitchen sink</h4>

<p>As much punishment as an industry-standard database can take, it’s probably not a good idea to not care at all about what’s going 
into 
it, treating it like a data landfill of sorts. Management, querying, backups, migrations - all becomes painful once the DB grows 
substantially. Even if that is of no concern as you are using a
managed cloud DB - the costs should be. An RDBMS is a sophisticated piece of technology, and storing data in it is <em>expensive</em>.</p>

<h3 id="figure-out-common-scale-first">Figure out common-scale first</h3>

<p>It is fairly easy to make a beefy Postgres or a MySQL database grind to a halt if you expect it to do magic without any extra 
work. <em>“It’s 
not web-scale, boss. Our 2 million records seem to be too much of a lift. We need DynamoDB, Kafka, and event
sourcing!”</em></p>

<p>A relational database is not some antiquated technology that only us tech fossils choose to be experts in, a thing that can be
waved off like an annoying insect. <em>“Here we React and GraphQL all the things, old man”</em>. In legal speak, a modern RDBMS is
innocent until proven guilty, and the burden of proof should be extremely 
high - and almost entirely on you.</p>

<p>Finally, if I have to figure out “why it’s slow”, my approximate runbook is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Compile a list of unique queries, from logging, slow query log, etc.</li>
  <li>Look at the most frequent queries first</li>
  <li>Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EXPLAIN</code> to check slow query plans for index usage</li>
  <li>Select only the data that needs to travel across the wire</li>
  <li>If an ORM is doing something silly without a workaround, pop the hood and get dirty with the raw SQL plumbing</li>
</ul>

<photo-element source="database-skills/merry-xmas.gif" aspect="landscape" alt="Merry Xmas!"></photo-element>

<p>Most importantly, study your database (and SQL). Learn it, love it, use it, abuse it. Spending a couple of days just leafing 
through that Postgres manual to see what it <em>can</em> do will probably make you a better engineer than spending more time on the next 
flavor-of-the-month JavaScript framework hotness. Again.</p>

<p>There is a pretty well-known sketch in which an engineer is explaining to the project manager how an overly complicated maze of 
microservices works in order to get a user’s birthday - and fails to do so anyway. The scene accurately describes the 
absurdity of the state of the current tech culture. We laugh, and yet bringing this up in a 
serious conversation is tantamount to professional heresy, rendering you borderline un-hirable.</p>

<p>How did we get here? How did our aim become not addressing the task at hand but instead setting a pile of 
cash on fire by <strong>solving problems we don’t have</strong>?</p>

<div class="sidebar">
<span>Trigger warning:</span> Some people understandably got salty when I name-checked JavaScript and NodeJS as a source 
of the problem, but my point really was more about the dangers of hermetically sealed software ecosystems that seem
hell-bent on re-learning the lessons that we just had finished learning. We ran into the complexity
wall before and reset - otherwise we'd still be using 
<a href="https://www.ra.ethz.ch/cdstore/www2002/alternate/395/index.html" target="_blank">CORBA and SOAP</a>. These

<h3 id="the-perfect-storm">The perfect storm</h3>

<p>There are a few events in recent history that may have contributed to the current state of things. First, a whole army of 
developers 
writing JavaScript for the browser started self-identifying as 
“full-stack”, diving into server development and asynchronous code. JavaScript is JavaScript, right? What difference does it make 
what you create using it - user interfaces, servers, games, or embedded systems. <em>Right</em>? 
Node was still kind of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3BM9TB-8yA" target="_blank">learning project of one person</a>, and 
the early JavaScript was a deeply problematic choice for server development.
<a href="https://notes.ericjiang.com/posts/751" target="_blank">Pointing this out</a> to still green server-side developers usually 
resulted in a lot of huffing and puffing. This is all they knew, after all. The world outside of Node 
effectively did not exist, the Node way was the only way, and so this was the genesis of the 
stubborn, dogmatic thinking that we are dealing with to this day.</p>

<photo-element source="complexity/theway.webp" aspect="original-size" alt="Performance"></photo-element>

<p><strong>And then</strong>, a steady stream of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech" target="_blank">FAANG</a> veterans started merging into the river of startups, 
mentoring the newly-minted and highly impressionable young JavaScript server-side engineers. The apostles of the Church of Complexity would 
assertively claim that “how they did things over at Google” was unquestionable and correct - even if it made no sense with the 
given context and size. What 
do you <em>mean</em> you don’t have a separate <em>User Preferences Service</em>? That just <em>will not scale, bro!</em></p>

<p>But, it’s easy to blame the veterans and the newcomers for all of this. What else was happening? Oh yeah - easy money.</p>

<p>What do you do when you are flush with venture capital? You don’t 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BzAdXyPYKQo?si=3lOVi1rhtaPC-nv4" target="_blank">go for revenue</a>, surely! On more than one 
occasion I received an email from management, asking everyone to be in the office, tidy up their desks and look busy, as a 
clouder of Patagonia vests was about to be paraded through the space. Investors needed to see explosive growth, but not in 
profitability, 
no. They just needed to see how quickly the company could hire ultra-expensive software engineers to do … <em>something</em>.</p>

<p>And now that you have these developers, what do you do with them? Well, they could build a simpler system that is easier to 
grow and
maintain, or they could conjure up a monstrous constellation of “microservices” that no one really 
understands. Microservices 
- the new way of writing scalable software! Are we just going to pretend that the concept of “distributed systems” never existed?
(Let’s skip the whole parsing of nuances about microservices not being real distributed systems).</p>

<p>Back in the days when the tech industry was not such a bloated farce, distributed systems were respected, feared, and generally 
avoided - reserved only as the weapon of last resort for particularly gnarly problems. Everything with a distributed system 
becomes more challenging and time-consuming - development, debugging, deployment, testing, resilience. But I don’t know - maybe 
it’s all super easy now because 
<em>toooollling</em>.</p>

<p>There is no standard tooling for microservices-based development - there is no common 
framework. Working on distributed systems has gotten only marginally easier in 2020s. The Dockers and the 
Kuberneteses of the world did not magically take away the inherent complexity of a distributed setup.</p>

<p>I love referring to this
<a href="https://kenkantzer.com/learnings-from-5-years-of-tech-startup-code-audits/" target="_blank">summary of 5 years of startup audits</a>, 
as it is packed with common-sense conclusions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… the startups we audited that are now doing the best usually had an almost brazenly ‘Keep It Simple’ approach to
engineering. Cleverness for cleverness sake was abhorred. On the flip side, the companies where we were like ”woah,
these folks are smart as hell” for the most part kind of faded.</p>

  <p>Generally, the major foot-gun that got a lot of places in trouble was the premature move to microservices, architectures 
that relied on distributed computing, and messaging-heavy designs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Literally - “complexity kills”.</p>

<p>The 
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/mt/podcast/lessons-from-5-years-of-startup-code-audits/id341623264?i=1000567623452" target="_blank">audit</a>
revealed an interesting pattern, where many startups experienced a sort of collective 
<a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/09/11/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-imposter-syndrome/" target="_blank">imposter syndrome</a>
while building straight-forward, simple,
performant systems. There is a stigma attached to not starting out with microservices on day one - 
no matter the problem. “Everyone is doing microservices, yet we have a single Django monolith maintained by just a few engineers, 
and a MySQL instance - what are we doing wrong?”. The answer is almost always “nothing”.</p>

<p>Likewise, it’s very often that seasoned engineers experience hesitation and inadequacy in today’s tech world, and the good news is 
that, no - it’s probably not you. It’s common for teams to pretend like they are doing “web scale”, hiding behind libraries, 
ORMs, and cache - confident in their expertise (they crushed that Leetcode!), yet they may not even be
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/f46f5a/comment/fhp26k8/?context=3" target="_blank">aware of database indexing basics</a>. 
You are operating in a sea of unjustified overconfidence, waste, and Dunning-Kruger, so who is really the imposter here?</p>

<h3 id="there-is-nothing-wrong-with-a-monolith">There is nothing wrong with a monolith</h3>

<p>The idea that you cannot grow without a system that looks like the infamous slide of Afghanistan war 
strategy is a myth.</p>

<photo-element source="complexity/af.png" aspect="landscape"></photo-element>

<p>Dropbox, Twitter, Netflix, Facebook, GitHub, Instagram, Shopify, StackOverflow - these companies and others started out as 
monolithic code bases. Many have a monolith at their core to this day. StackOverflow makes it a 
<a href="https://stackexchange.com/performance" target="_blank">point of pride</a> how little hardware they need to run the massive site. 
Shopify is still a <a href="https://blog.quastor.org/p/shopify-ensures-consistent-reads">Rails monolith</a>, leveraging the tried and true 
Resque to process 
<a href="https://twitter.com/ShopifyEng/status/1597983928018948096" target="_blank">billions of tasks</a>.</p>

<p>WhatsApp went supernova with their 
<a href="https://blog.quastor.org/p/whatsapp-scaled-1-billion-users-50-engineers" target="_blank">Erlang monolith and a relatively small team</a>.
How?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>WhatsApp consciously keeps the engineering staff small to only about 50 engineers.</p>

  <p>Individual engineering teams are also small, consisting of 1 - 3 engineers and teams are each given a great deal of autonomy.</p>

  <p>In terms of servers, WhatsApp prefers to use a smaller number of servers and vertically scale each server to the highest 
extent possible.</p>

<p>Instagram was acquired for billions - with a crew of 12.</p>

<p>And do you imagine Threads as an effort involving a whole Meta campus? Nope. They followed the
<a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/static-analysis-at-scale-an-instagram-story-8f498ab71a0c" target="_blank">Instagram model</a>, 
and this is the entire Threads team:</p>

<p>Perhaps claiming that <em>your</em> particular problem domain requires a massively complicated distributed system and an open office 
stuffed to the gills with turbo-geniuses is just crossing over into 
arrogance rather than brilliance?</p>

<h3 id="dont-solve-problems-you-dont-have">Don’t solve problems you don’t have</h3>

<p>It’s a simple question - what problem are you solving? Is it scale? How do you know how to break it all up for scale and performance? 
Do you have enough data to show what needs to be a separate service and why? Distributed systems are built for size and 
resilience. Can your system scale and be resilient at the same time? What happens if one of the services goes down or comes to a crawl? 
Just scale it up? What about the <em>other</em> services that are going to get hit with traffic? Did you war-game the endless 
permutations of things that can and will go wrong? Is there backpressure? Circuit breakers? Queues? Jitter? Sensible timeouts on every 
endpoint? Are there fool-proof guards to make sure a simple change does not bring everything down? 
The knobs you need to be aware of and tune are endless, and they are all specific to your system’s particular signature of 
usage and load.</p>

<p>The truth is that most companies will never reach the massive size that will actually require building a true distributed 
system. Cosplaying Amazon and Google - without their scale, expertise, and endless resources - is very likely just an egregious 
waste of money and time. Religiously 
following all the steps from an article called “Ten morning habits of very successful people” is not going to make you a 
billionaire.</p>

<p><em>The only thing harder than a distributed system is a BAD distributed system</em>.</p>

<photo-element source="complexity/twitter3.png" aspect="original-size" alt="Performance"></photo-element>

<h3 id="but-each-team-but-separate-but-api">“But each team… but separate… but API”</h3>

<p>Trying to shove a distributed topology into your company’s structure is a noble effort, but it almost always backfires. It’s a 
common approach 
to break up a problem into smaller pieces and then solve those one by one. So, the thinking goes, if you break up one service 
into multiple ones, everything becomes easier.</p>

<p>The theory is sweet and elegant - each microservice is being maintained rigorously by a dedicated team, 
walled off behind a beautiful, backward-compatible, versioned API. In fact, this is so solid that you rarely even have to 
communicate with that team - as if the microservice was maintained by a 3rd party vendor. It’s <em>simple</em>!</p>

<p>If that doesn’t sound familiar, that’s because this rarely happens. In reality, our Slack channels are <em>flooded</em> with 
messages from teams communicating about releases, bugs, configuration updates, breaking changes, and PSAs. Everyone 
needs to be on top of everything, all the time. And if that wasn’t great, it’s normal for one 
already-slammed team to half-ass multiple 
microservices instead of doing a great job on a single one, often changing ownership as people come and go.</p>

<p>In order to win the race, we don’t build <em>one</em> good race car - we build a fleet of shitty golf carts.</p>

<photo-element source="complexity/twitter2.png" aspect="original-size" alt="Performance"></photo-element>

<h3 id="what-you-lose">What you lose</h3>

<p>There are multiple pitfalls to building with microservices, and often that minefield is either not fully appreciated or simply 
ignored. Teams spend months writing highly customized tooling and learning lessons not 
related at all to the core product. Here are just some often overlooked aspects…</p>

<h4 id="say-goodbye-to-dry">Say goodbye to DRY</h4>

<p>After decades of teaching developers to write Don’t Repeat Yourself code, it seems we just stopped talking about it altogether.
Microservices by default are not DRY, with every service stuffed with redundant boilerplate. Very often the overhead of such 
“plumbing” is so heavy, and the size of the microservices is so small, that the average instance of a service has more “service” 
than 
“product”. So what about the common code that <em>can</em> be factored out?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a common library?</li>
  <li>How does the common library get updated? Keep different versions everywhere?</li>
  <li>Force updates regularly, creating dozens of pull requests across all repositories?</li>
  <li>Keep it all in a monorepo? That comes with its <em>own</em> set of problems.</li>
  <li>Allow for some code duplication?</li>
  <li>Forget it, each team gets to reinvent the wheel every time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each company going this route faces these choices, and there are no good “ergonomic” options - you <em>have</em> to 
choose your version of the pain.</p>

<h4 id="developer-ergonomics-will-crater">Developer ergonomics will crater</h4>

<p>“Developer ergonomics” is the friction, the amount of effort a developer
must go through in order to get something done, be it working on a new feature or resolving a bug.</p>

<p>With microservices, an engineer has to have a mental map of the entire system in order to know what services  to bring up for any 
particular task, what teams to talk to, whom to talk to, and what about. The “you have to know everything before 
doing anything” 
principle. How 
do you keep on top of it? Spotify, a 
multi-billion dollar company, spent probably not negligible internal resources to build 
<a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/" target="_blank">Backstage</a>, software for cataloging its endless systems and services.</p>

<p>This should at least give you a clue that this game is not for everyone, and the price of the ride is <em>high</em>. So what about 
the <em>tooooling</em>? The Not Spotifies of the world are left with MacGyvering their own solutions, robustness and portability of 
which you can probably guess.</p>

<p>And how many teams actually streamline the process of starting a <em>YASS</em> - “yet another stupid service”? 
This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Developer privileges in GitHub/GitLab</li>
  <li>Default environment variables and configuration</li>
  <li>CI/CD</li>
  <li>Code quality checkers</li>
  <li>Code review settings</li>
  <li>Branch rules and protections</li>
  <li>Monitoring and observability</li>
  <li>Test harness</li>
  <li>Infrastructure-as-code</li>
</ul>

<p>And of course, multiply this list by the number of programming languages used throughout the company. Maybe you have a 
usable 
template or a runbook? Maybe a frictionless, one-click system to 
launch a new service from scratch? It takes months to iron out all the kinks with this kind of automation. So, you can either 
work on your product, or you can be working on <em>toooooling</em>.</p>

<h4 id="integration-tests---lol">Integration tests - LOL</h4>

<p>As if the everyday microservices grind was not enough, you also forfeit the peace of mind offered by solid integration tests. 
Your single-service and unit tests are passing, but are your critical paths still intact after 
each commit? Who is in charge of the overall integration test suite, in Postman or wherever else? Is there one?</p>

<photo-element source="complexity/unit.gif" aspect="original-size" alt="Service tests"></photo-element>

<p>Integration testing a distributed setup is a nearly-impossible problem, so we pretty much gave up on that and replaced it with 
another one - Observability. Just like “microservices” are the new “distributed systems”, “observability” is the new 
“debugging in production”. Surely, you are not writing real software if you are not doing…. observability!</p>

<p>Observability has become its own sector, and you will pay in both pretty penny and in developer 
time for it. It doesn’t come as plug-and-pay either - you need to understand and implement canary releases, feature flags, etc. 
Who is doing that? One already 
<a href="/2023/07/26/i-am-not-your-cloud-person.html">overwhelmed</a> engineer?</p>

<p>As you can see, breaking up your problem does not make solving it easier - all you get is another set of <em>even 
harder problems</em>.</p>

<h3 id="no-a-monolith-does-not-mean-better-code">No, a monolith does not mean “better code”</h3>
<p>All these arguments often get interpreted as if the suggestion here is that monoliths are “good code” and microservices
are “most likey bad code”. The latter is probably true, but never have I suggested that monolithic code is good by default.
The world runs on mediocre monoliths, written by rushed teams, or just mediocre ones.</p>

<p>Distributed systems, on the other hand, are unforgiving of cut corners, bad decisions, and overlooked failure modes.
You need to be on top of your game <em>all the time</em> or you <em>will</em> get penalized.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-just-services">What about just “services”?</h3>

<p>Why do your services need to be “micro”? What’s wrong with
<a href="https://leeatchison.com/app-architectures/moving-beyond-microservices-hype/" target="_blank">just services</a>? Some
startups have gone as far as create 
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28938038" target="_blank">a service for each function</a>, and yes, “isn’t that just like 
Lambda” is a 
valid question. This 
gives you an idea of how far gone this unchecked cargo cult is.</p>

<p>So what do we do? 
<a href="https://www.fearofoblivion.com/build-a-modular-monolith-first" target="_blank">Starting with a monolith</a>
is one obvious choice. A pattern that could also  work in many instances is “trunk &amp; 
branches”, where the main “meat and potatoes” monolith is helped by “branch” services. A branch service can be one that 
takes care of a clearly-identifiable and separately-scalable load. A CPU-hungry <em>Image-Resizing Service</em> makes way more sense than 
a <em>User Registration Service</em>. Or do you get so many registrations per second that it requires independent horizontal scaling?</p>

<photo-element source="complexity/really.gif" aspect="original-size" alt="Vertical"></photo-element>

<div class="sidebar">
<span>Side note:</span> In version control, back in the days of CVS and Subversion, we rarely used "master" branches. We had 
"trunk and branches" because, you know - *trees*. "Master" branches appeared somewhere along the way, and when GitHub decided 
to do away with the rather unfortunate naming convention, the average 
engineer was too young to remember about "trunk" - and so the generic "main" default came to be.

<h3 id="the-pendulum-is-swinging-back">The pendulum is swinging back</h3>
<p>The hype, however, seems to be dying down. The VC cash faucet is tightening, and so the
businesses have been market-corrected into exercising common-sense decisions, recognizing that perhaps splurging on 
web-scale architectures when they don’t have web-scale problems, is not sustainable.</p>

purchase an Amtrak train ticket for a 90-minute ride. <em>That</em> is the problem at hand.</p>

<p><em>Attention</em> is arguably the most precious resource of the 21st century. Technology companies have expended incredible efforts to 
improve the ways in which they capture our attention and convert it into revenue. That fight for the 
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/08/why-every-tech-company-turns-into-an-ad-company.html" target="_blank">nine unmonetized glances</a>.</p>

<p>An “addictive” app or device is not merely a figure of speech. Your compulsion to check your phone without any specific reason is 
not significantly different from any other form of dependence. Substance addiction is psychoactive, 
whereas this is behavioral, but the effect is strikingly similar. “Addictive” technology has transformed us all into seekers 
of micro-dopamine hits, with attention spans akin to that of a squirrel.</p>

<h3>Your brain - now rewired</h3>
<p>Johann Hari starts <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stolen-Focus-Attention-Think-Deeply-ebook/dp/B093G9TS91/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1688580010&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Stolen Focus</a> 
with a story of how he realized - after going device and Internet-free as an experiment -
that he is no longer able to sit down and finish a chunk of a book without his mind wondering off.</p>

<p>Hari has been called out for <a href="https://twitter.com/DrMatthewSweet/status/1479125912490848262" target="_blank">cherry-picking scientific studies</a>, and yet the book could stand on anecdotal 
evidence alone, as the concepts he discusses are profoundly relatable. Even as a fidgety teenager, I remember being laser-focused for hours on chapters of
the next science fiction book, to the point where my parents were getting worried about me not playing enough outside. Now? I
am not able to get through half a page without thinking of checking <em>something</em>. Similarly, at the (home) office, getting deep 
work done has gotten extremely challenging.</p>

<p>As proof that Hari’s (and mine) observations are not that unique, Nicholas Carr
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/306868/" target="_blank">noticed the same thing</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Over the past few years I’ve had an uncomfortable sense that someone, or something, has been tinkering with my brain,
remapping the neural circuitry, reprogramming the memory. My mind isn’t going—so far as I can tell—but it’s changing.
I’m not thinking the way I used to think.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m not the only one. When I mention my troubles with reading to friends and acquaintances—literary types, most of them—many say
they’re having similar experiences. The more they use the Web, the more they have to fight to stay focused on long
pieces of writing. Some of the bloggers I follow have also begun mentioning the phenomenon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The kicker? <strong>This was written in 2008</strong>.</p>

<p>Why is that notable? Because just before - 2007 - was
a <a href="https://www.theagileelephant.com/5-reasons-why-2007-was-a-tipping-point-and-a-turning-point-in-our-digital-journey/" target="_blank">pivotal year</a>
in the evolution of the internet:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Twitter and Facebook go into hyper-growth</li>
  <li>Steve Jobs launches the iPhone</li>
  <li>Hadoop brings the rise of Big Data</li>
</ul>

<photo-element source="focus/social-network.jpg" alt="Supernova" credit="The Facebook going supernova in The Social Network. Credit: Sony Pictures."></photo-element>

<p>Nicholas Carr and his “literary friends” noticed their focus slipping away even back when they used the <em>classic</em> web,
before we had the Internet on our phones all day long, buzzing with notifications, and before Slack or Microsoft Teams gnawed
at our productivity. The boiling frog effect has made us unaware of just how bad it has gotten.</p>

<p>Later, Carr wrote a whole book on the subject -
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shallows-What-Internet-Doing-Brains/dp/0393357821/" target="_blank">The Shallows</a>. Back in 
2011 the book might have been met with a scoff, and many people did just that. Now, however, this subject is coming back 
with a fiery vengeance. Carr was just much more attuned to the changes in his attention span than most other people. I
pushed the panic button only after realizing I could spend three days in a row on Twitter without accomplishing a single thing.</p>

<p>Social media, device notifications, and work group chats have changed the way we process information. Think about your regular
session on an app such as X-itter. You doom-scroll through items, and they are <i>very
different</i> items, forcing your brain to switch context rapidly and violently:</p>

<ul class="regular">
  <li>A troll says something repulsive - "triggered"</li>
  <li>A dog does something funny - "lol"</li>
  <li>A study shows that X amount of Y every day may be good for you - "interesting!"</li>
  <li>A large company gets fined for violating the law - "yay justice!"</li>
  <li>The market is down - "ugh"</li>
</ul>

<p>All of THAT will happen within 1 or 2 minutes, your brain taken for a wild ride of
news and whimsy. Much of the content will have articles attached, but you don’t click and read those - you are “power
browsing”. This ritual is taxing and exhausting, sapping your power to focus.
This is why taking a break from work on social
media <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-07-unstructured-minute-attention.html" target="_blank">does not count as rest</a>.</p>

<p>Do this long enough, and your brain will learn to pay attention to things only in small doses. It will
seek small things to process - group chat pings, text notifications, headline alerts. Like hamsters, we are now trained to
be in this relentless loop of FOMO.</p>

<p>The situation with work chat has reached obnoxious levels as well, where it’s
impossible to get 5 minutes of peace without being distracted. There is a channel for <em>everything</em>. We are yet to 
come to terms with the tab incurred from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/dec/15/distraction-economy-technology-downgraded-attention-facebook-tinder" target="_blank">distraction economy</a>, 
but the data is beginning to come in - and it’s not good.</p>

<p>Rani Molla writes in 
<a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/1/18511575/productivity-slack-google-microsoft-facebook" target="_blank">“The productivity pit: how Slack is ruining work”</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Much like the ubiquitous open-floor plan, this type of software is meant to get different parts of a company working together,
to break down hierarchies, to spark chance interactions and innovations.</p>

  <p>In practice, it can be hell.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="there-is-a-pill-for-that">There is a pill for that</h3>

<p>Is it any surprise that (in the United States), the consumption of focus-enhancing stimulants has
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/16/magazine/generation-adderall-addiction.html" target="_blank">skyrocketed</a>? Adults who 
previously had no issues with focus now find themselves struggling, and students have gone as far as getting
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/03/us/nyu-organic-chemistry-petition.html" target="_blank">professors dismissed</a> due to their inability to concentrate on courses that have been successfully taught for 
decades.</p>

<p>While ADHD is a genuine condition, it’s worth asking - did some of us develop ADHD suddenly at the age of 37? Did we 
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/whyd-i-take-speed-for-twenty-years/id1614253637?i=1000632809966" target="_blank">ever have it</a>? 
Is it necessary to alter our brain chemistry to get through the day, or has the excessive fast-scrolling on Instagram turned 
more than five sentences at once so hard to process? Maybe instead of resorting to medical-grade meth and speed for our focus 
problems we should try and go for the root cause first?</p>

<h3 id="what-can-we-do">What can we do?</h3>

<p>For some of us, the reflex to switch context for no reason is so strong that <i>self-limiting</i> does not work. Just like food 
diets do not work, a screen diet doesn’t either. It’s not a quick fix - it’s a lifestyle change (or a lifestyle rollback?).</p>

<p>So what can we do? There are basic things to try, but these are pretty well-known:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Uninstall addictive apps that sap your time</li>
  <li>Ruthlessly disable notifications for apps that keep bothering you</li>
  <li>Mute noisy work chat channels</li>
  <li>Do not check your phone before going to sleep, in the middle of the night, or right after you wake up</li>
</ul>

<p>This baseline TODO, however, still requires discipline and many for us will quickly go back to our old ways of being easily
distracted. From my personal experimentation, perhaps you will find some of these mental (and physical) tricks useful…</p>

<h4 id="oxygen">Oxygen</h4>

<p>One mental device I came up with is to imagine my attention (which <i>is</i> a finite resource) as oxygen in a spaceship.
Once I “open” the airlock, I lose that oxygen/attention at a very rapid pace. So every time my mind wonders off in search of a
distraction, I ask myself: “do I want to open the airlock and lose my attention oxygen now?”</p>

<photo-element source="focus/airlock.jpg" alt="Airlock" credit="You are a hermetically-sealed attention spaceship - yes you are 
(source: Maxon)"></photo-element>

<h4 id="separate-from-your-device">Separate from your device</h4>

<p>Why not just <i>leave your phone behind entirely</i> for a non-critical amount of time when going outside?
Before the smartphones and before people were used to texting, I would disappear in the NYC subway and no one would know where
I was for hours, unless I dropped a quarter and called on a NYNEX pay phone. Ask yourself - what could be so end-of-the-world
catastrophic that you <i>must</i> respond now and not in, say, 45 minutes?</p>

<p>Try and leave your phone behind when you get out of the office for lunch, for example - alone or with your colleagues. After
the initial freak-out, a sense of zen is going to settle in - and
it will feel <i>glorious</i>. If not alone, your colleagues will also appreciate you not planting your face in that phone while 
they are trying to have a conversation over lunch - an added benefit.</p>

<photo-element source="focus/payphone.png" alt="New York City payphone" credit="Good old days and a pair of nasty NYC 
payphones"></photo-element>

<h4 id="say-no-to-mission-control-work-setup">Say NO to “mission control” work setup</h4>

<p>While that fourth monitor is going to look ultra-cool, perhaps you should go back - <em>to one</em>. It’s not clear how the constant 
movement of logs, messages, and popups that you notice with the corner of your eye is supposed to help 
you do deep work. There is a reason IDEs now offer “focus mode”, where all you see is your editor and nothing else. This is a 
silly trend that should seriously be questioned.</p>

<photo-element source="focus/multiple-monitors.jpg" alt="Mission control" credit="Houston, we have a problem"></photo-element>

<p>There are some kinds of work where multiple monitor setup is helpful. Specifically, where context switching and 
distraction <em>is</em> the nature of the job, but for focus work? Perhaps you need that second screen for fast preview of content? 
Operating systems offer quick virtual desktop switching, which is just as good. The screens are getting so huge that even that 
is not necessary - just go splitsies on the screen real estate.</p>

<h4 id="producerconsumer-mode">Producer/consumer mode</h4>

<p>No matter how many Marvel moves you watch, the truth is that none of us are super-human - <a href="https://hbr.org/2010/12/you-cant-multi-task-so-stop-tr" target="_blank">our brain is not capable of multitasking</a>. It can only do somewhat 
fast yet taxing context switching. It’s fine if your day consists of small tasks. In knowledge work, however, it makes the process of getting into the flow very fragile. Do you notice
how, after you finally get into the flow, even you are impressed with how much you can crank out?</p>

<p>The next time you sit down at
your work station, think about what mode you <i>want</i> to be in: are you a producer, or an
attention-wasting consumer? You <i>cannot</i> be both.</p>

<h4 id="background-café-noise">Background café noise</h4>

<p>I am personally not a fan of working in coffee shops (I cannot focus with all the comings and goings), but some people do
find those helpful for concentration. Curiously, a simulation of café ambience does help me get in the zone when I am working 
from home, at low volume, using a 
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/33FiXrPqAW1gYMxFfFgWcm?si=uzkVR-D_QriQT_b-nuAssQ" target="_blank">playlist like this</a> (Spotify).</p>

<h4 id="pink-white-and-brown-noise">Pink, white, and brown noise</h4>

<p>If your woe is a very noisy open-office work environment where the constant jibber-jabber is making you, uh, stabby 
(noise-cancelling
headphones are not that effective against human voice frequencies), 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhgL3y-oDAs" target="_blank">the combo of pink white and brown noises</a> 
will put you at 30 thousand feet and inside a humming passenger plane. The hum drowns out human voices, helping you
get in the zone.</p>

<h4 id="your-device-has-a-focus-mode">Your device has a Focus Mode</h4>

<p>Both <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/782433/how-to-use-focus-mode-on-android/" target="_blank">Android</a> and 
<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212608" target="_blank">iOS</a> operating systems
now have Focus Modes. This mutes all of your notifications but allows for exceptions, in order to let emergencies get through.</p>

<h4 id="dedicate-a-distraction-device">Dedicate a “distraction device”</h4>
<p>You may also want to dedicate an old laptop or a tablet as your “distraction device”. It can certainly not be your phone.
Introduce a certain barrier of entry - don’t let distraction be within a simple reach of a hand. 
The goal is to force yourself to make a conscious decision - “I am going to walk away from my work station now and waste time”.</p>

<h4 id="the-password-confidant">The password “confidant”</h4>

<p>If you are being a totally difficult customer who has zero impulse control, use a
password confidant - a person that you can trust with your account. Here is how this works:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Transfer your [social media] account to <i>the other person’s</i> email and phone number</li>
  <li>Use the problem app until you know you should stop</li>
  <li>Change the password but do not memorize or save it!</li>
  <li>Log out</li>
  <li>When you seriously need the fix, reset the password and bother the confidant for the confirmation
code</li>
</ul>

<p>The benefit of this system is that you have to actually ping someone else about the password reset, and you cannot abuse that
trust, as your confidant can only be disturbed only so many times before they start getting tired of your antics. They own your
account, so be nice.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-read">What to read</h3>
<p>I mentioned the “FOMO loop” before. It’s not really that - it’s the <em>habit loop</em>. I have read many books on compulsive 
behavior, but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X" target="_blank">The Power of Habit</a> is 
really the one that explains to the laymen why we are locked in the doom 
loop of bad behavior - be it drinking, checking the fridge for a snack out of boredom, or biting your nails. “The Power of Habit” doesn’t 
really go into compulsive device use, and it doesn’t have to - the mechanics of these behaviors are identical. It’s 
key to understanding and undoing the re-wiring done to us.</p>

<photo-element source="focus/power-of-habit.jpg" aspect="portrait" alt="The Power of Habit"></photo-element>

<h3 id="what-to-watch">What to watch</h3>

<p>Tacky dramatizations aside, <a href="https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/" target="_blank">The Social Dilemma</a> is a pretty good 
crash course in how large tech 
companies malt your attention (and you) into a product. None of this is new information, but it is presented in a digestible 
manner. In short: to an algorithm - we are just a bunch of marketing dimensions, constantly refined, until the algorithm knows 
about what we are going to want and need <em>before we do</em>.</p>

<h3 id="its-an-ongoing-fight">It’s an ongoing fight</h3>
<p>Regaining and keeping your focus is hard. You will almost inevitably relapse into time-wasting routines, but
hopefully this can be a starting point and a toolkit. It’s a struggle, and while we may not be winning the war yet, it’s 
time to start winning some battles.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have been trained against consuming long-form information]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">I Am Not Your Cloud Person</title><link href="https://renegadeotter.com/2023/07/26/i-am-not-your-cloud-person.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="I Am Not Your Cloud Person" /><published>2023-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://renegadeotter.com/2023/07/26/i-am-not-your-cloud-person</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://renegadeotter.com/2023/07/26/i-am-not-your-cloud-person.html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="jack-of-all-clouds">Jack of all clouds</h3>

<p>In an episode of
<a href="https://www.lastweekinaws.com/podcast/screaming-in-the-cloud/" target="_blank">Screaming in the Cloud podcast</a>,
Corey Quinn, a cloud services expert, mentioned a running prank that he sometimes pulls on Amazon engineers: Quinn 
inserts a fictional AWS service name into the conversation, with the AWS person not batting an eye. Even Amazon’s employees 
do not have the complete grasp of all the vast Cloud offerings their own company provides. And what chance do the rest of us have?</p>

<photo-element source="cloudops/card.png" aspect="portrait" alt="Jacks of all trades"></photo-element>

<h3 id="this-is-not-2002">This is not 2002</h3>

<p>Nowadays, the concept of a “full-stack engineer” is rarely a thing, at least not professionally. The days of a simple HTML site 
with a Perl CGI script as your “backend” are gone, and so are the days of “webmaster@domain.com” email addresses. Software development has become a 
sprawling field. Not only did the ways of doing things have grown exponentially, but we now have less time to 
<a href="/2023/08/24/getting-your-focus-back.html" target="_blank">focus on them</a>. A common software development team is no longer a 
handful of male nerds with bad hygiene, cranking out code with little supervision and little understanding of their work 
by anyone else. It is now a more diverse, more collaborative, and a more conventional place of business. This naturally comes 
with an overhead of inefficiency. There is way more complexity, there are more meetings and lines of communication, with 
fewer and fewer hours in the day for improving ourselves at one specific thing. Your precious “10x developer” is now probably 
answering Slack messages every 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Keeping up with all the new developments and “hot” new frameworks in the Javascript ecosystem alone can be 
draining, and dev/cloud ops is 
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/10p4bw5/the_amount_of_change_in_devopscloud_is_exhausting/" target="_blank">no different</a>. 
Why, then, do we expect software engineers to be Cloud experts?</p>

<p>Let’s list just some of the things we expect a typical software engineer to do day to day:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Develop new features</li>
  <li>Review code</li>
  <li>Stay on top of the latest “best practices”</li>
  <li>Be an expert on observability - or debugging complex distributed systems in production</li>
  <li>Write and maintain scripts that make local development possible</li>
  <li>Attend in-person and remote meetings</li>
  <li>Participate in a stream of work chat messages</li>
  <li>Compose and maintain code documentation, API documentation, WIKIs</li>
  <li>Onboarding</li>
  <li>Create presentations for knowledge transfer</li>
  <li>Mentor junior developers</li>
  <li>Be proficient with infrastructure-as-code and frameworks such as CloudFormation or Terraform</li>
  <li>Understand which architecture patterns match a certain scale or a use case</li>
  <li>Understand database engines and their applications</li>
  <li>And this: have in-depth knowledge of which Cloud solutions are appropriate, cheap, and secure</li>
</ul>

<photo-element source="cloudops/mailroom.png" aspect="landscape" alt="Working in the mailroom"></photo-element>

<p>This is an insane list of expectations, where one single bullet point alone can easily be someone’s full-time job. Not only is 
it impossible to be fluent in all of this, this leads to critical developer blind spots. We are becoming satisfactory at 
everything and good at nothing.</p>

<p>Ken Kantzer, of the startup auditing firm PKC, 
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/mt/podcast/lessons-from-5-years-of-startup-code-audits/id341623264?i=1000567623452" target="_blank">mentioned</a>
in the Changelog podcast a common case of software developers <em>not understanding that JWT tokens are not encrypted by default</em>.
Developers were shown plain-text version of their own JWT tokens, to their amazement - with sensitive information right there 
for anyone to read.</p>

<p>You expect the same engineers to also have the bandwidth to understand the intricacies of cost dynamics in a multi-region AWS 
setup? Which brings us to…</p>

<h3 id="knows-just-enough-to-be-dangerous">“Knows just enough to be dangerous”</h3>

<p>A developer who knows zero of something is probably better for your infrastructure security than a developer who knows half
(but thinks they know it all).</p>

<p>Software vendors go out of their way to make their products user-friendly, working out-of-the-box in order to push for fast 
ramp up and adoption. 
That often comes at the price of literally no security. “Look, ma! I installed Mongo and it just works. I have 
gone web scale, ma!”</p>

<p>What ma knew and what the developer didn’t was that Mongo did not set a password by default, so the giddy engineer who 
mirrored their local setup when going to production just exposed the production database to the world as a 
free-for-all. That ended up just about 
<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-ransoms-23k-mongodb-databases-and-threatens-to-contact-gdpr
-authorities/" target="_blank">how you would expect</a>.</p>

<p>MongoDB is not the only culprit, either. There have been spectacular security breaches stemming from Amazon AWS allowing 
<a href="https://techbeacon.com/security/aws-finally-adds-default-privacy-setting-s3-buckets" target="_blank">wide-open S3 buckets</a>
with public access ON by default.</p>

<p>Once the technology in question gets more complicated, so are the ways in which it can be misconfigured. Making your engineers
administer Kubernetes is probably not the greatest of ideas, as the “working knowledge” is just enough to get it working
but not enough to be aware of all the security caveats and pitfalls (and not just security, really).</p>

<p>Still, even if you are lucky enough to not have been ransomwared into oblivion, there will be a price…</p>

<h3 id="it-will-cost-you">It will cost you</h3>

<p>Your cloud bill is directly proportional to the size of your team. In part to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law" target="_blank">Conway’s Law</a>, and in part because many workplaces give 
teams autonomy, which manifests as those teams piling on their favorite Cloud toys without any regard for performance, cost, 
security, or overall complexity.</p>

<p>As your engineers add whatever they desire to your already extensive 
cloud infrastructure, who really gets down and dirty with a cloud cost calculator? Who analyzes the redundancies, or 
cheaper and simpler ways? Who gets to validate that rebuilding your entire application in Lambda is not just someone’s 
resume-driven development effort but a pragmatic decision, not resulting in nasty 
<a href="https://einaregilsson.com/serverless-15-percent-slower-and-eight-times-more-expensive/" target="_blank">performance and cost surprises</a>?
Who tracks how much data is stored where, accumulating in cost every month? Can it be moved? Deleted? Compressed and 
archived? Give me a second - I will get right on that after I finish my standup, two Zoom meetings, prep to conduct an 
interview, attend to technical debt, and spin up another goddamned microservice.</p>

<p>With the Cloud, everything seems reasonably priced and simple - at first, until
<a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-we-re-leaving-the-cloud-654b47e0" target="_blank">someone notices the bill</a>.
In these lean times, when tech companies are forced to be only <em>reasonably</em>
frugal, everything seems fine - and then it’s a code red emergency with all hands on deck. “Our cloud bill is 
too high, fix it!”</p>

<h3 id="a-shallow-ocean-sized-puddle-of-knowledge">A shallow, ocean-sized puddle of knowledge</h3>
<p>Non-stop learning is part of this job, but the ever-growing amount of things to know is relentless and even paralyzing. Basic 
knowledge of things like database indexes and 
<a href="https://www.mux.com/blog/what-are-react-server-components" target="_blank">server-side rendering</a>
is passé.</p>

<p>In this environment, expecting software engineers to also be masters of Clouds is, as we say, an anti-goal.</p>
