<p>Some in the JavaScript community <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_9JYPLU-8s&amp;t=404s">imagine that I harbour an irrational dislike of their tools</a> when, in fact, I want nothing more than to stop thinking about them. Live-and-let-live is excellent guidance, and if it weren't for React <em>et. al.</em>'s predictably ruinous outcomes, the public side of my work wouldn't involve educating about <a href="https://infrequently.org/series/performance-inequality/">the problems JS-first development has caused.</a></p>
<p>But that's not what strategy demands, and strategy is my job.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/10/platforms-are-competitions/#fn-ecosystem-strategy-is-a-weird-job-1" id="fnref-ecosystem-strategy-is-a-weird-job-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>I've been holding my fire (and the confidences of consulting counterparties) for most of the last decade. Until <a href="https://infrequently.org/series/reckoning/">this year,</a> I only occasionally posted traces documenting the worsening rot. I fear this has only served to make things look <em>better</em> than they are.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, my work helping teams deliver competitive PWAs gave me a front-row seat to a disturbing trend. The rate of failure to deliver usable experiences on phones was <em>increasing</em> over time, despite the eye-watering cost of JS-based stacks teams were reaching for. Worse <em>and</em> costlier is a bad combo, and the opposite of what competing ecosystems did.</p>
<p>Native developers reset <em>hard</em> when moving from desktop to mobile, getting deeply in touch with the new constraints. Sure, developing a codebase multiple times is more expensive than the web's write-once-test-everywhere approach, but at least you got speed for the extra cost.</p>
<p>That's not what web developers did. Contemporary frontend practice pretended that legacy-oriented, desktop-focused tools would perform fine in this new context, without ever checking if they <em>did</em>. When that didn't work, the toxic-positivity crowd blamed the messenger.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/10/platforms-are-competitions/#fn-failure-on-repeat-2" id="fnref-failure-on-repeat-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Frontend's <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/caprock/">tragically timed turn towards JavaScript</a> means the damage isn't limited to <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/object-lesson/">the public sector</a> or &quot;bad&quot; developers. Some of the strongest engineers I know find themselves mired in the same quicksand. Today's popular JS-based approaches are simply unsafe at any speed. The rot is now ecosystem-wide, and JS-first culture owns a share of the responsibility.</p>
<p>But why do I care?</p>
<h2 id="platforms-are-competitions">Platforms Are Competitions <a class="permalink" href="https://infrequently.org/2024/10/platforms-are-competitions/#platforms-are-competitions">#</a></h2>
<p>I want the web to win.</p>
<p>What does that mean? Concretely, folks should be able to accomplish most of their daily tasks on the web. But capability isn't sufficient; for the web to win in practice, users need to turn to the browser for those tasks because it's easier, faster, and more secure.</p>
<p>A reasonable metric of success is <em>time spent as a percentage of time on device</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/10/platforms-are-competitions/#fn-thirst-traps-3" id="fnref-thirst-traps-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>But why should we prefer one platform over another when, in theory, they can deliver equivalently good experiences?</p>
<p>As I see it, the web is the only generational software platform that has a reasonable shot at delivering a potent set of benefits to users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fresh</li>
<li>Frictionless</li>
<li>Safe by default</li>
<li>Portable and interoperable</li>
<li>Gatekeeper-free (no prior restraint on publication)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/10/platforms-are-competitions/#fn-our-awol-tech-press-4" id="fnref-our-awol-tech-press-4">[4]</a></sup></li>
<li>Standards-based, and therefore...</li>
<li>User-mediated (extensions, browser settings, etc.)</li>
<li>Open Source compatible</li>
</ul>
<p>No other successful platform provides all of these, and others that could are too small to matter.</p>
<p>Platforms like Android and Flutter deliver subsets of these properties but capitulate to capture by the host OS agenda, allowing their developers to be taxed through app stores and proprietary API lock-in. Most treat user mediation like a bug to be fixed.</p>
<p>The web's inherent properties have created an ecosystem that is unique in the history of software, both in scope and resilience.</p>
<h2 id="...and-we're-losing">...and We're Losing <a class="permalink" href="https://infrequently.org/2024/10/platforms-are-competitions/#...and-we're-losing">#</a></h2>
<p>So why does this result in intermittent antagonism towards today's JS community?</p>
<p>Because the web is losing, and instead of recognising that we're all in it together, then pitching in to right the ship, the <a href="https://infrequently.org/2023/02/the-market-for-lemons/">Lemon Vendors</a> have decided that predatory delay and <em>&quot;I've got mine, Jack&quot;</em>-ism is the best response.</p>
<p>What do I mean by &quot;losing&quot;?</p>
<p>Going back to the time spent metric, the web is cleaning up on the desktop. The web's JTBD percentage and fraction of time spent both continue to rise as we add new capabilities to the platform, displacing other ways of writing and delivering software, one fraction of a percent every year.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/10/platforms-are-competitions/#fn-no-kos-5" id="fnref-no-kos-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The web is desktop's indispensable ecosystem. Who, a decade ago, thought the web would be such a threat to Adobe's native app business that it would need to respond with a <a href="https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2022/adobe-to-acquire-figma">$20BN acquisition attempt</a> and a full-fledged version of <a href="https://web.dev/articles/ps-on-the-web">Photoshop (<em>real</em> Photoshop) on the web?</a></p>
<p>Model advantages grind slowly but finely. They create space for new competitors to introduce the intrinsic advantages of their platform in previously stable categories. But only when specific criteria are met.</p>
<h2 id="win-condition">Win Condition <a class="permalink" href="https://infrequently.org/2024/10/platforms-are-competitions/#win-condition">#</a></h2>
<p>First and foremost, challengers need <strong>a cost-competitive channel</strong>. That is, users have to be able to acquire software that runs on this new platform without a lot of extra work. The web drops channel costs to nearly zero, assuming...</p>
<p><strong>80/20 capability</strong>. Essential use-cases in the domain have to be (reliably) possible for the vast majority (90+%) of the TAM. Some nice-to-haves might not be there, but the model advantage makes up for it. Lastly...</p>
<p><strong>It has to feel good</strong>. Performance can't suck for core tasks.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/10/platforms-are-competitions/#fn-status-tracking-6" id="fnref-status-tracking-6">[6]</a></sup> It's fine for UI consistency with native apps to wander a bit.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/10/platforms-are-competitions/#fn-ui-coherence-7" id="fnref-ui-coherence-7">[7]</a></sup> It's even fine for there to be a large peak performance delta. But the gap can't be such a gulf that it generally changes the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/debug-test-perf/planning-and-measuring-performance#time">interaction class</a> of common tasks.</p>
<p>So if the web is meeting all these requirements on desktop – even running away with the lead – why am I saying &quot;the web is losing&quot;?</p>
<p>Because <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/265878/global-shipments-of-pcs-tablets-ultra-mobiles-mobile-phones/">more than 75% of new devices that can run full browsers are phones</a>. And the web is getting <em>destroyed</em> on mobile.</p>
<p>Utterly routed.</p>

<p>If that graph looks rough-but-survivable, understand that it's only this high in the US (and other Western markets) because the web was <em>already</em> a success in those geographies when mobile exploded.</p>
<p>That history isn't shared in the most vibrant growth markets, meaning the web has fallen from &quot;minuscule&quot; to &quot;nonexistent&quot; as a part of mobile-first daily life globally.</p>
<p>This is the landscape. The web is extremely likely to get cast in amber and will, in less than a technology generation, become a weird legacy curio.</p>
<p>What happens then? The market for web developers will stop expanding, and the safe, open, interoperable, gatekeeper-free future for computing will be entirely foreclosed — or at least the difficulty will go from &quot;slow build&quot; to &quot;cold-start problem&quot;; several orders of magnitude harder (and therefore unlikely).</p>
<p>This failure has many causes, but they're all tractable. This is why I have worked so hard to close the capability gaps with <a href="https://web.dev/learn/pwa/service-workers">Service Workers</a>, <a href="https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/">PWAs</a>, <a href="https://web.dev/explore/notifications">Notifications</a>, <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/capabilities/fugu-showcase">Project Fugu</a>, and <a href="https://www.chromium.org/blink/launching-features/">structural solutions</a> to the <a href="https://infrequently.org/2020/06/platform-adjacency-theory/">governance problems</a> that <a href="https://infrequently.org/2015/08/doing-science-on-the-web/">held back progress.</a> All of these projects have been motivated by the logic of platform competition, and the urgency that comes from understanding that that web doesn't have a natural constituency.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/10/platforms-are-competitions/#fn-fair-weather-friends-8" id="fnref-fair-weather-friends-8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>If you've read any of my writing over this time, it will be unsurprising that this is why I eventually had to break silence and <a href="https://infrequently.org/series/browser-choice-must-matter/">call out what Apple has done on iOS, and what Facebook and Android have done to more quietly undermine browser choice.</a></p>
<p>These gatekeepers are kneecapping the web in different, but overlapping and reinforcing ways. There's much more to say here, but I've tried to lay out the landscape <a href="https://infrequently.org/series/browser-choice-must-matter/">over the past few years,</a>. But even if we break open the necessary 80/20 capabilities and restart engine competition, today's web is unlikely to succeed on mobile.</p>
<h2 id="you-do-it-to-yourself%2C-and-that's-what-really-hurts">You Do It To Yourself, And That's What Really Hurts <a class="permalink" href="https://infrequently.org/2024/10/platforms-are-competitions/#you-do-it-to-yourself%2C-and-that's-what-really-hurts">#</a></h2>
<p>Web developers and browsers have capped the web's mobile potential by ensuring it will feel terrible on <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/01/performance-inequality-gap-2024/">the phones most folks have.</a> A web that can win is a web that doesn't feel like sludge. And today it does.</p>
<p>This failure has many fathers. Browsers have not done nearly enough to intercede on users' behalf; hell, we don't even warn users that links they tap on might take them to sites that lock up the main thread for seconds at a time!</p>
<p>Things have gotten so bad that even the extremely weak pushback on developer excess that Google's <a href="https://web.dev/articles/vitals">Core Web Vitals</a> effort provides is a slow-motion earthquake. <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/05/introducing-inp">INP,</a> in particular, is forcing even the worst JS-first lemon vendors to <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components">retreat to the server</a> — a tacit acknowledgement that their shit stinks.</p>
<p>So this is the strategic logic of why web performance matters in 2024; for the web to survive, it must start to grow on mobile. For that growth to start, we need the web to be a credible way to deliver these sorts of 80/20 capability-enabled mobile experiences with not-trash performance. That depends both on browsers that don't suck (we see you, Apple) and websites that don't consistently lock up phones and drain batteries.</p>
<p>Toolchains and communities that retreat into the numbing comfort of desktop success are a threat to that potential.</p>
<p>There's (much) more for browsers to do here, but developers that want the web to succeed can start without us. Responsible, web-ecology-friendly development is more than possible today, and the great news is that <a href="https://wpostats.com/">it tends to make companies more money, too!</a></p>
<p>The JS-industrial-complex culture that pooh-poohs responsibility is self-limiting and a harm to our collective potential.</p>
<h2 id="groundhog-day">Groundhog Day <a class="permalink" href="https://infrequently.org/2024/10/platforms-are-competitions/#groundhog-day">#</a></h2>
<p>Nobody has ever hired me to work on performance.</p>
<p>It's (still) on my plate because terrible performance is a limiting factor on the web's potential to heal and grow. Spending nearly half my time diagnosing and remediating easily preventable failure <em>is not fun</em>. The teams I sit with <em>are not having fun either</em>, and goodness knows there are APIs I'd <em>much</em> rather be working on instead.</p>
<p>My work today, and for the past 8 years, has only included performance because until it's fixed <em>the whole web</em> is at risk.</p>
<p>It's actually that dire, and <a href="https://infrequently.org/series/performance-inequality/">the research I publish</a> indicates that we are not on track to cap our JS emissions or mitigate them with CPUs fast enough to prevent ecosystem collapse.</p>
<p>Contra the framework apologists, pervasive, preventable failure to deliver usable mobile experiences <em>is</em> often because we're dragging around IE 9 compat and long toolchains premised on outdated priors like a ball and chain.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/10/platforms-are-competitions/#fn-sinking-costs-9" id="fnref-sinking-costs-9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="reboot">Reboot <a class="permalink" href="https://infrequently.org/2024/10/platforms-are-competitions/#reboot">#</a></h2>
<p>Things look bad, and I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge that it could just be too late. Apple and Google and Facebook, with the help of a pliant and credulous JavaScript community, might have succeeded where 90s-era Microsoft failed — we just don't know it yet.</p>
<p>But it seems equally likely that the web's advantages are just dormant. When browser competition is finally unlocked, and when web pages aren't bloated with <a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-javascript">half a megabyte of JavaScript (on average)</a>, we <em>can</em> expect a revolution. But we need to prepare for that day and do everything we can to make it possible.</p>
<p>Failure and collapse aren't pre-ordained. We <em>can</em> do better. We <em>can</em> grow the web again. But to do that, the frontend community has to decide that user experience, the web's health, and their own career prospects are more important than whatever JS-based dogma VC-backed SaaS vendors are shilling this month.</p>

<section class="footnotes">
  <ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn-ecosystem-strategy-is-a-weird-job-1" class="footnote-item"><p>My business card says <em>&quot;Product Manager&quot;</em> which is an uncomfortable fudge in the same way <em>&quot;Software Engineer&quot;</em> was an odd fit in my dozen+ years on the Chrome team.</p>
<p>My job on both teams has been somewhat closer to <em>&quot;Platform Strategist for the Web&quot;</em>. But nobody hires platform strategists, and when they do, it's to support proprietary platforms. The tactics, habits of mind, and ways of thinking about platform competition for open vs. closed platforms could not be more different. Indeed, I've seen many successful proprietary-platform folks try their hand at open systems and bounce hard off the different constraints, cultures, and &quot;soft power&quot; thinking they require.</p>
<p>Doing strategy on behalf of a collectively-owned, open system is extremely unusual. Getting paid to do it is almost unheard of. And the job itself is strange; because facts about the ecosystem develop slowly, there isn't a great deal to re-derive from current events.</p>
<p>Companies also don't ask strategists to design and implement solutions in the opportunity spaces they identify. But solving problems is the only way to deliver progress, so along with others who do roughly similar work, I have camped out in roles that allow arguments about the health of the web ecosystem to motivate the concrete engineering projects necessary to light the fuse of web growth.</p>
<p>Indeed, nobody <em>asked</em> me to work on web performance, just as nobody <em>asked</em> me to develop PWAs, in the same way that nobody <em>asked</em> me to work on the capability gap between web and native. Each one falls out of the sort of strategy analysis I'm sharing in this post for the first time. These projects are examples of the sort of work I think anyone would do once they understood the stakes and marinated in the same data.</p>
<p>Luckily, inside of browser teams, I've found that largely to be true. Platform work attracts long-term thinkers, and those folks are willing to give strategy analysis a listen. This, in turn, has allowed the formation of large collaborations (like <a href="https://www.chromium.org/teams/web-capabilities-fugu/">Project Fugu</a> and <a href="https://conffab.com/in_person_session/summit-23-front-end-engineering-afternoon-day-2/">Project Sidecar</a> to tackle the burning issues that pro-web strategy analysis yields.</p>
<p>Strategy without action isn't worth a damn, and action without strategy can easily misdirect scarce resources. It's a strange and surprising thing to have found a series of teams (and bosses) willing to support an oddball like me that works both sides of the problem space without direction.</p>
<p>So what is it that I do for a living? Whatever working to make the web a success for another generation demands. <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/10/platforms-are-competitions/#fnref-ecosystem-strategy-is-a-weird-job-1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>

<p>It's bewildering to see today's tech press capitulate to the gatekeepers. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/">The Register</a> and <a href="https://thenewstack.io/">The New Stack</a> stand apart in using above-the-fold column inches to <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/02/28/apple_apps_challenge/">cover</a> just how <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/21/eu_apple_owa/">rancid</a> and self-dealing <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/27/inapp_browsers/">Apple, Google, and Facebook's suppression</a> of the mobile web has been.</p>
<p>Most can't even summon <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/01/the-web-is-the-app-store/">their opinion bytes to highlight how broken the situation has become</a>, or how the alternative would benefit everyone, even though it would <em>directly</em> benefit those outlets.</p>

</li>
<li id="fn-no-kos-5" class="footnote-item"><p>There are rarely KOs in platform competitions, only slow, grinding changes that look &quot;boring&quot; to a tech press that would rather report on social media contratemps.</p>
<p>Even the smartphone revolution, which featured never before seen device sales rates, took most of a decade to overtake desktop as the dominant computing form-factor. <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/10/platforms-are-competitions/#fnref-no-kos-5" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-status-tracking-6" class="footnote-item"><p>The web wasn't always competitive with native on desktop, either. It took Ajax (new capabilities), Moore's Law (RIP), and broadband to make it so. There had to be enough overhang in CPUs and network availability to make the performance hit of the web's languages and architecture largely immaterial.</p>
<p>This is why I continue to track the <a href="https://infrequently.org/series/performance-inequality/">mobile device and network situation.</a> For the mobile web to take off, it'll need to overcome similar hurdles to usability on most devices.</p>
<p>The only way that's likely to happen in the short-to-medium term is for developers to emit less JS per page. And <a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-javascript">that is not what's happening.</a> <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/10/platforms-are-competitions/#fnref-status-tracking-6" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-ui-coherence-7" class="footnote-item"><p>One common objection to metaplatforms like the web is that the look and feel versus &quot;native&quot; UI is not consistent. The theory goes that consistent affordances create less friction for users as they navigate their digital world. This is a nice theory, but in practice the more important question in the fight between web and native look-and-feel is which one users encounter more often.</p>
<p>The dominant experience is what others are judged against. On today's desktops, browsers that set the pace, leaving OSes with reduced influence. OS purists decry this as an abomination, but it just is what it is. &quot;Fixing&quot; it gains users very little.</p>
<p>This is particularly true in a world where OSes change up large aspects of their design languages every half decade. Even without the web's influence, this leaves a trail of unreconciled experiences sitting side-by-side uncomfortably. Web apps aren't an unholy disaster, just more of the same. <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/10/platforms-are-competitions/#fnref-ui-coherence-7" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-fair-weather-friends-8" class="footnote-item"><p>No matter how much they protest that they love it (sus) and couldn't have succeeded without it (true), the web is, at best, an also-ran in the internal logic of today's tech megacorps. They can do platform strategy, too, and know that that exerting direct control over access to APIs is worth its weight in Californium. As a result, the preferred alternative is always the proprietary (read: directly controlled and therefore taxable) platform of their OS frameworks. API access gatekeeping enables distribution gatekeeping, which becomes a business model chokepoint over time.</p>
<p>Even Google, the sponsor of the projects I pursued to close platform gaps, couldn't summon the organisational fortitude to inconvenience the Play team for the web's benefit. For its part, Apple froze Safari funding and API expansion almost as soon as the App Store took off. Both benefit from a cozy duopoly that forces businesses into the logic of heavily mediated app platforms.</p>
<p>The web isn't suffering on mobile because it isn't good enough in some theoretical sense, it's failing on mobile because the duopolists directly benefit from keeping it in a weakened state. And because the web is a collectively-owned, reach-based platform, neither party has to have their fingerprints on the murder weapon. At current course and speed, the web will die from a lack of competitive vigour, and nobody will be able to point to the single moment when it happened.</p>
<p>That's by design. <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/10/platforms-are-competitions/#fnref-fair-weather-friends-8" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-sinking-costs-9" class="footnote-item"><p>Real teams, doing actual work, aren't nearly as wedded to React vs., e.g., Preact or Lit or FAST or Stencil or Qwik or Svelte as the JS-industrial-complex wants us all to believe. And moving back to the server entirely is even easier.</p>
<p>React is the last of the totalising frameworks. Everyone else is living in the interoperable, plug-and-play future (via Web Components). Escape doesn't hurt, but it can be scary. But teams that want to do better aren't wanting for off-ramps. <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/10/platforms-are-competitions/#fnref-sinking-costs-9" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-the-softest-target-10" class="footnote-item"><p>It's hard to overstate just how fair this is to the over-Reactors. The (still) more common <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/">Create React App</a> <s>metaframework</s> starter kit would suffer terribly by comparison, and Vercel has had years of browser, network, and CPU progress to water down the negative consequences of Next.js's blighted architecture.</p>

<p>Everyone in a site's production chain has agency to prevent <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/object-lesson/">disaster.</a> Procurement leads, in-house IT staff, and the managers, PMs, and engineers working for contractors and subcontractors building the SNAP sites we examined all had voices that were more powerful than the users they under-served. Any of them could have acted to steer the ship away from the rocks.</p>
<p>Unacceptable performance is the consequence of a chain of failures to put the user first. Breaking the chain usually requires just one insistent advocate. Disasters like BenefitsCal are not inevitable.</p>

<p>The same failures play out in the commercial teams I sit with day-to-day. Failure is not a foregone conclusion, yet there's an endless queue of sites stuck in the same ditch, looking for help to pull themselves out. JavaScript overindulgence is always an affirmative decision, no matter how hard industry &quot;thought leaders&quot; gaslight us.</p>
<p>Marketing that casts highly volatile, serially failed frontend frameworks as &quot;standard&quot; or required is horse hockey. Nobody can force an entire industry to flop so often it limits its future prospects.</p>
<p><em>These are choices.</em></p>
<p>Teams that succeed resolve to stand for the users first, then explore techniques that build confidence.</p>
<p>So, assuming we want to put users first, what approaches can even the odds? There's no silver bullet,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/the-way-out/#fn-secret-sauce-3" id="fnref-secret-sauce-3">[3]</a></sup> but some techniques are unreasonably effective.</p>
<h2 id="managers">Managers <a class="permalink" href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/the-way-out/#managers">#</a></h2>
<p>Engineering managers, product managers, and tech leads can make small changes to turn the the larger ship dramatically.</p>
<p>First, <strong>institute critical-user-journey analysis.</strong></p>
<p>Force peers and customers to agree about what actions users will take, <em>in order</em>, on the site most often. Document those flows end-to-end, then automate testing for them end-to-end in something like <a href="https://docs.webpagetest.org/scripting/">WebPageTest.org's scripting system.</a> Then define key metrics around these journeys. Build dashboards to track performance <em>end-to-end</em>.</p>
<p>Next, <strong>reform your frontend hiring processes.</strong></p>
<p>Never, ever hire for JavaScript framework skills. Instead, interview and hire only for fundamentals like web standards, accessibility, modern CSS, semantic HTML, and Web Components. This is <em>doubly</em> important if your system uses a framework.</p>
<p>The push-back to this sort of change comes from many quarters, but I can assure you from deep experience that the folks you <em>want</em> to hire can learn anything, so the framework on top of the platform is the least valuable part of any skills conversation. There's also a glut of folks with those talents on the market, and they're vastly underpriced vs. their effectiveness, so &quot;ability to hire&quot; isn't a legitimate concern. Teams that can't find those candidates aren't trying.</p>
<p>Some teams are in such a sorry state regarding fundamentals that they can't even vet candidates on those grounds. If that's your group, don't hestitate to <a href="https://infrequently.org/about-me/">reach out.</a></p>
<p>In addition to attracting the most capable folks at bargain-basement prices, delivering better work more reliably, and spending less on <a href="https://polotek.net/posts/the-frontend-treadmill/">JavaScript treadmill taxes</a>, publicising these criteria sends signals that will attract more of the right talent over time. Being the place that <em>&quot;does it right&quot;</em> generates compound value. The best developers want to work in teams that prize their deeper knowledge. Demonstrate that respect in your hiring process.</p>
<p>Next, <strong>issue every product and engineering leader cheap phones and laptops.</strong></p>
<p>Senior leaders should set the expectation those devices will be used regularly and for real work, including visibly during team meetings. If we do not live as our customers, blind spots metastasise.</p>
<p>Lastly, climb the <a href="https://infrequently.org/2022/05/performance-management-maturity/">Performance Management Maturity ladder</a>, starting with <strong>latency budgets for every project</strong>, based on the previously agreed critical user journeys. They are foundational in building a culture that does not backslide.</p>
<h2 id="engineers-and-designers">Engineers and Designers <a class="permalink" href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/the-way-out/#engineers-and-designers">#</a></h2>
<p>Success or failure is in your hands, literally. Others in the equation may have authority, but you have <em>power</em>.</p>
<p>Begin to use that power to make noise. <strong>Refuse to go along with plans to build YAJSD (Yet Another JavaScript Disaster).</strong> Engineering leaders look to their senior engineers for trusted guidance about what technologies to adopt. When someone inevitably proposes the React rewrite, do not be silent. Do not let the bullshit arguments and nonsense justifications pass unchallenged. Make it clear to engineering leadership that this stuff is <em>expensive</em> and is <a href="https://toot.cafe/@slightlyoff/112933241646309021"><em>absolutely not</em> &quot;standard&quot;.</a></p>
<p><strong>Demand bakeoffs and testing on low-end devices.</strong></p>
<p>The best thing about cheap devices is they're cheap! So inexpensive that you can likely afford a low-end phone out-of-pocket, even if the org doesn't issue one. Alternatively, <a href="https://webpagetest.org/">WebPageTest.org</a> can generate high-quality, low-noise simulations and side-by-side comparisons of the low-end situation.</p>
<p>Write these comparisons into testing plans early.</p>
<p>Advocate for <strong>metrics and measurements that represent users at the margins.</strong></p>
<p>Teams that have climbed the <a href="https://infrequently.org/2022/05/performance-management-maturity/">Performance Management Maturity ladder</a> intuitively look at the highest percentiles to understand system performance. Get comfortable doing the same, and build that muscle in your engineering practice.</p>
<p>Build the infrastructure you'll need to <strong>show, rather than tell.</strong> This can be dashboards or app-specific instrumentation. Whatever it is, just build it. Nobody in a high-performing engineering organisation will be ungrateful for additional visibility.</p>
<p>Lastly, <strong><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/using-webpagetest/9781491902783/ch04.html">take side-by-side traces</a></strong> and wave them like a red shirt.</p>
<p>Remember, none of the other people in this equation are working to undercut users, but they rely on you to guide their decisions. Be a class traitor; do the right thing and speak up for users on the margins who can't be in the room where decisions are made.</p>

<p>If your organisation is unfamiliar with the UK Government Digital Service's excellent <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/">Service Manual</a>, get reading.</p>
<p>Once everyone has put their copy down, <strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/using-progressive-enhancement">institute the UK's progressive enhancement standard</a> and make it an enforceable requirement</strong> in procurement.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/the-way-out/#fn-pe-exceptions-4" id="fnref-pe-exceptions-4">[4]</a></sup> The cheapest architecture errors to fix are the ones that weren't committed.</p>
<p>Next, <strong>build out critical-user-journey maps</strong> to help bidders and in-house developers understand system health. Insist on dashboards to monitor those flows.</p>
<p>Use <strong>tender processes to send clear signals</strong> that proposals which include SPA architectures or heavy JS frameworks (React, Angular, etc.) will face acceptance challenges.</p>
<p>Next, <strong>make space in your budget to hire senior technologists</strong> and give them oversight power with teeth.</p>
<p>The root cause of many failures is the continuation of too-big-to-fail contracting. The antidote is scrutiny from folks versed in systems, not only requirements. An effective way to build and maintain that skill is to stop writing omnibus contracts in the first place.</p>
<p>Instead, farm out smaller bits of work to smaller shops across shorter timelines. Do the integration work in-house. <a href="https://infrequently.org/2013/04/two-governments-both-alike-in-dignity/">That will necessitate maintaining enough tech talent to own and operate these systems, building confidence over time.</a></p>
<p>Reforming procurement is always challenging; old habits run deep. But it's possible to start with the very next RFP.</p>

<p>Today's frontend community is in crisis.</p>
<p>If it doesn't look that way, it's only because the instinct to deny the truth is now fully ingrained. But the crisis is incontrovertable in the data. If the web had grown at the same pace as mobile computing, mobile web browsing would be more than a 1/3 larger than it is today. Many things are holding the web back — Apple springs to mind — but pervasive JavaScript-based performance disasters are doing their fair share.</p>
<p>All of the failures I documented in public sector sites are things I've seen dozens of times in industry. When an e-commerce company loses tens or hundreds of millions of dollars because the new CTO fired the old guard out to make way for a bussload of Reactors, it's just (extremely stupid) business. But the consequences of frontend's accursed turn towards all-JavaScript-all-the-time are not so readily contained. Public sector services that should have known better are falling for the same malarkey.</p>
<p>Frontend's culture has more to answer for than lost profits; we consistently fail users and the companies that pay us to serve them because we've let <a href="https://infrequently.org/2023/02/the-market-for-lemons/">unscrupulous bastards sell snake oil</a> without consequence.</p>
<p>Consider the alternative.</p>
<p>Canadian engineers graduating college are all given an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Ring">iron ring</a>. It's a symbol of professional responsibility to society. It also recognises that every discipline must earn its <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/social-license-slo.asp">social license to operate.</a> Lastly, it serves as a reminder of the consequences of shoddy work and corner-cutting.</p>

<p>I want to be a part of a frontend culture that accepts and promotes our responsibilities to others, rather than wallowing in self-centred &quot;DX&quot; puffery. In the hierarchy of priorities, users must come first.</p>
<p>What we do in the world matters, particularly our vocations, not because of how it affects us, but because our actions improve or degrade life for others. It's hard to imagine that culture while the JavaScript-industrial-complex has seized the commanding heights, but we should try.</p>
<p>And then we should act, one project at a time, to make that culture a reality.</p>

<p>Last time, <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/object-lesson/">we looked at</a> how JavaScript-based web development compounded serving errors on US public sector service sites, slowing down access to critical services. These defects are not without injury. The pain of accessing SNAP assistance services in California, Massachusetts, Maryland, Tennessee, New Jersey, and Indiana likely isn't dominated by the shocking performance of their frontends, but their glacial delivery isn't helping.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/opinion/sunday/why-waiting-in-line-is-torture.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Bk4.c_y7.EhyNmle0_aTb&amp;smid=url-share">Waits are a price that developers ask users to pay</a> and loading spinners <a href="https://www.speedcurve.com/blog/psychology-site-speed/">only buy so much time.</a></p>
<h2 id="complexity-perplexity">Complexity Perplexity <a class="permalink" href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/caprock/#complexity-perplexity">#</a></h2>
<p>These SNAP application sites create hurdles to access because the departments procuring them made or green-lit inappropriate architecture choices. In fairness, those choices may have seemed reasonable given JavaScript-based development's capture of the industry.</p>
<p>Betting on JavaScript-based, <a href="https://web.dev/articles/rendering-on-the-web">client-side rendered</a> architectures leads to complex and expensive tools. <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/object-lesson/#fn-receipts-1">Judging by the code delivered over the wire,</a> neither CalSAWS nor Deloitte understand those technologies well enough to operate them proficiently.</p>
<p>From long experience and a review of the <a href="https://www.calsaws.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/BenefitsCal-Cumulative-Metrics-Report-June-2024.pdf">metrics (pdf)</a> the <a href="https://www.calsaws.org/">CalSAWS Joint Management Authority</a> reports, it is plain as day that the level of <a href="https://infrequently.org/2022/05/performance-management-maturity/">organisational and cultural sophistication</a> required to deploy a complex JavaScript frontend is missing in Sacramento:</p>
<p><lite-youtube videoid="t3smBkiGUWw" videoStartAt="1:01" videotitle="Dora Militaru | Performance culture through the looking-glass"></lite-youtube></p>
<p>It's safe to assume a version of the same story played out in Annapolis, Nashville, Boston, Trenton, and Indianapolis.</p>
<p>JavaScript-based UIs are fundamentally more challenging to own and operate because the limiting factors on their success are outside the data center and not under the control of procuring teams. <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/01/performance-inequality-gap-2024/#situation-report">The slow, flaky networks and low-end devices</a> that users bring to the party define the envelope of success for client-side rendered UI.</p>
<p>This means that any system that puts JavaScript in the critical path starts at a disadvantage. Not only does JavaScript cost 3x more in processing power, byte-for-byte, than HTML and CSS, but it also removes the browser's <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/inside-browser-part3">ability to parallelise page loading.</a> SPA-oriented stacks also <em>preload</em> much of the functionality needed for future interactions by default. Preventing over-inclusion of ancilliary code generally requires extra effort; work that is not signposted up-front or well-understood in industry.</p>
<p>This, in turn, places hard limits on scalability that arrive <em>much</em> sooner than with HTML-first progressive enhancement.</p>
<p>Consider today's 75-percentile mobile phone<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/caprock/#fn-P75-1" id="fnref-P75-1">[1]</a></sup>, a device like the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_a50-9554.php">Galaxy A50</a> or the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_g100-12373.php">Nokia G100:</a></p>

<p>A device like this presents hard limits on network, RAM, and CPU resources. Because JavaScript is more expensive than HTML and CSS to process, and because SPA architectures frontload script, these devices create a cap on the scalability of SPAs.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/caprock/#fn-hydration-hayfever-2" id="fnref-hydration-hayfever-2">[2]</a></sup> Any feature that needs to be added once the site's bundle reaches the cap is in tension with every other feature in the site until exotic route-based code-splitting tech is deployed.</p>
<p>JavaScript bundles tend to grow without constraint in the development phase and can easily tip into territory that creates an unacceptable experience for users on slow devices.</p>
<p>Only bad choices remain once a project has reached this state. I have worked with dozens of teams surprised to have found themselves in this ditch. They all feel slightly ashamed because they've been led to believe they're the first; that the technology is working fine for <em>other</em> folks.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/caprock/#fn-omerta-as-market-failure-3" id="fnref-omerta-as-market-failure-3">[3]</a></sup> Except it isn't.</p>
<p>I can almost recite the initial remediation steps in my sleep.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/caprock/#fn-recommendations-4" id="fnref-recommendations-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The remaining options are bad for compounding reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Digging into an experience that has been broken with JS inevitably raises a litany of issues that all need unplanned remediation.</li>
<li>Every new feature on the backlog would add to, rather than subtract from, bundle size. This creates pressure on management as feature work grinds to a halt.</li>
<li>Removing code from the bundle involves investigating and investing in new tools and deeply learning parts of the tower of JS complexity everyone assumed was &quot;fine&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>These problems don't generally arise in HTML-first, progressively-enhanced experiences because costs are lower at every step in the process:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML and CSS are byte-for-byte cheaper for building an equivalent interface.</li>
<li>&quot;Routing&quot; is handled directly by the browser and the web platform through forms, links, and REST. This removes the need to load code to rebuild it.</li>
<li>Component definitions can live primarily on the server side, reducing code sent to the client.</li>
<li>Many approaches to progressive enhancement (rather than &quot;rehydration&quot;) use browser-native Web Components, eliminating both initial and incremental costs of larger, legacy-oriented frameworks.</li>
<li>Because there isn't an assumption that script is critical to the UX, users succeed more often <a href="https://medium.com/@jason.godesky/when-javascript-fails-52eef47e90db">when it isn't there.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This model reduces the initial pressure level and keeps the temperature down by limiting the complexity of each page to what's needed.</p>
<p>Teams remediating underperforming JavaScript-based sites often make big initial gains, but the difficulty ramps up once egregious issues are fixed. The residual challenges highlight the higher structural costs of SPA architectures, and must be wrestled down the hard (read: &quot;expensive&quot;) way.</p>
<p>Initial successes also create cognitive dissonance within the team. Engineers and managers armed with experience and evidence will begin to compare themselves to competitors and, eventually, question the architecture they adopted. Teams that embark on this journey <a href="https://infrequently.org/2022/05/performance-management-maturity/">can (slowly) become masters of their own destinies.</a></p>
<p>From the plateau of enlightenment, it's simple to look back and acknowledge that for most sites, the pain, chaos, churn, and cost associated with SPA technology stacks are entirely unnecessary. From that vantage point, a team can finally, firmly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/using-progressive-enhancement">set policy.</a></p>
<h2 id="carrying-capacity">Carrying Capacity <a class="permalink" href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/caprock/#carrying-capacity">#</a></h2>
<p>Organisations that purchase and operate technology all have a base carrying capacity. The cumulative experience, training, and OpEx budgets of teams set the level.</p>
<p>Traditional web development presents a model that many organisations have learned to manage. The incremental costs of additional HTML-based frontends are well understood, from authorisation to database capacity to the intricacies of web servers</p>
<p>SPA-oriented frameworks? Not so much.</p>
<p>In practice, the complex interplay of bundlers, client-side routing mechanisms, GraphQL API endpoints, and the need to rebuild monitoring and logging infrastructure creates wholly unowned areas of endemic complexity. This complexity is experienced as a shock to the operational side of the house.</p>
<p>Before, developers deploying new UIs would cabin the complexity and cost within the data center, enabling mature tools to provide visibility. SPAs and client-side rendered UIs invalidate all of these assumptions. A common result is that the operational complexity of SPA-based technologies creates new, additive points of poorly monitored system failure — failures like the ones we have explored in this series.</p>
<p>This is an industry-wide scandal. Promoters of these technologies have not levelled with their customers. Instead, they continue to flog each new iteration as &quot;the future&quot; despite the widespread failure of these models outside sophisticated organisations.</p>
<p>The pitch for SPA-oriented frameworks like React and Angular has always been contingent — we <em>might</em> deliver better experiences <em>if</em> long chains of interactions can be handled faster on the client.</p>
<p>It's time to acknowledge this isn't what is happening. For most organisations building JavaScript-first, the next dollar spent after launch day is likely go towards recovering basic functionality rather than adding new features.</p>
<p>That's no way to run a railroad.</p>
<h3 id="should-this-be-an-spa%3F">Should This Be An SPA? <a class="permalink" href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/caprock/#should-this-be-an-spa%3F">#</a></h3>
<p>Public and private sector teams I consult with regularly experience ambush-by-JavaScript.</p>
<p>This is the predictable result of buying into frontend framework orthodoxy. That creed hinges on the idea that toweringly complex and expensive stacks of client-side JavaScript are necessary to deliver <em>better user experiences</em>.</p>
<p>But this has always been a contingent claim, at least among folks introspective enough to avoid suggesting JS frameworks for every site. Indeed, most web experiences should explicitly avoid both client-side rendered SPA UI and the component systems built to support them. Nearly all sites would be better off opting for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement">progressive enhancement</a> instead.</p>
<p>Doing otherwise is to invite the complexity fox into the OpEx henhouse. Before you know it, you're fighting with &quot;SSR&quot; and &quot;islands&quot; and &quot;hybrid rendering&quot; and &quot;ISR&quot; to get back to the sorts of results a bit of PHP or Ruby and some CSS deliver for a tenth the price.</p>
<p>So how can teams evaluate the appropriateness of SPAs and SPA-inspired frameworks? By revisiting the arguments offered by the early proponents of these approaches.</p>
<p>The <em>entirety</em> of SPA orthodoxy springs from the logic of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)">Ajax revolution</a>. As a witness to, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dojo_Toolkit">and early participant in,</a> that movement, I can conclusively assert that the buzz around GMail and Google Maps and many other &quot;Ajax web apps&quot; was their ability to <em>reduce latency for subsequent interactions</em> once an up-front cost had been paid.</p>
<p>The logic of this trade depends, then, on the length of sessions. As we have discussed before, <a href="https://infrequently.org/2022/03/a-unified-theory-of-web-performance/">it's not clear that even GMail clears the bar</a> in all cases.</p>
<p>The utility of the next quanta of script is <em>intensely</em> dependent on session depth.</p>

<p>Very few sites match the criteria for SPA architectures.</p>
<p>Questions managers can use to sort wheat from chaff:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the average session feature more than 20 updates to, or queries against, the <em>same</em> subset of global data?</li>
<li>Does this UI require features that naturally create long-lived sessions (e.g., chat, videoconferencing, etc.), and are those the site's primary purpose?</li>
<li>Is there a reason the experience can't be progressively enhanced (e.g., audio mixing, document editing, photo manipulation, video editing, mapping, hardware interaction, or gaming)?</li>
</ul>
<p>Answering these questions requires understanding critical user journeys. Flows that are most important to a site or project should be written down, and then re-examined through the lens of the marginal networks and devices of the user base.</p>
<p>The rare use-cases that are natural fits for today's JS-first dogma include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Document editors of all sorts</li>
<li>Chat and videoconferencing apps</li>
<li>Maps, geospatial, and BI visualisations</li>
</ul>
<p>Very few sites should lead with JS-based, framework-centric development.</p>
<p>Teams can be led astray when sites include mutliple apps under a single umberella. The canonical example is WordPress; a blog reading experience for millions and a blog editing UI for dozens. Treating these as independent experiences with their own constraints and tech stacks is more helpful than pretending that they're actually a &quot;single app&quot;. This is also the insight behind the &quot;islands architecture&quot;, and transfers well to other contexts, assuming the base costs of an experience remain low.</p>
<h3 id="the-pits">The Pits <a class="permalink" href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/caprock/#the-pits">#</a></h3>
<p>DevTools product managers use the phrase <em>&quot;pit of success&quot;</em> to describe how they hope teams experience their tools. The alternative is the (more common) <em>&quot;pit of ignorance&quot;.</em></p>
<p>The primary benefit of progressive enhancement over SPAs and SPA-begotten frameworks is that they leave teams with simpler problems, closer to the metal. Those challenges require attention and focus on the lived experience, which can be remediated cheaply once identified.</p>
<p>The alternative is considerably worse. In a previous post <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/object-lesson/#fn-bull-in-a-china-shop-5">I claimed that:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>SPAs are &quot;YOLO&quot; for web development.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is because an over-reliance on JavaScript moves responsibility for <em>everything</em> into the main thread in the most expensive way.</p>
<p>Predictably, teams whose next PR adds to JS weight rather than HTML and CSS payloads will find themselves in the drink faster, and with tougher path out.</p>
<p>What's gobsmacking is that so many folks have seen these bets go sideways, yet continue to participate in the pantomime of JavaScript framework conformism. These tools aren't delivering except in the breach, but nobody will say so.</p>
<p>And if we were only lighting the bonuses of overpaid bosses on fire through under-delivery, that might be fine. But the JavaScript-industrial-complex is now hurting families in my community trying to access the help they're entitled to.</p>
<p>It's not OK.</p>
<h2 id="aftermath">Aftermath <a class="permalink" href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/caprock/#aftermath">#</a></h2>
<p>Frontend is mired in a practical and ethical tar pit.</p>
<p>Not only are teams paying unexpectedly large premiums to keep the lights on, a decade of increasing JavaScript complexity hasn't even delivered the better user experiences we were promised.</p>
<p>We are not getting better UX for the escalating capital and operational costs. Instead, the results are getting <em>worse</em> for folks on the margins. JavaScript-driven frontend complexity hasn't just driven out the CSS and semantic-markup experts that used to deliver usable experiences for everyone, it is now <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/01/performance-inequality-gap-2024/">a magnifier of inequality.</a></p>
<p>As <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/01/performance-inequality-gap-2024/#fn-self-preservation-3">previously noted</a>, engineering is designing under constraint to develop products that serve users and society. The opposite of engineering is bullshitting, substituting fairy tales for inquiry and evidence.</p>
<p>For the frontend to earn and keep its stripes as an engineering discipline, frontenders need to internalise the envelope of what's possible on most devices.</p>
<p>Then we must take responsibility.</p>

<p>The Nokia G100 is by no means a hard target. Teams aspiring to excellence should look further down the price and age curves for representative compute power.

<li id="fn-hydration-hayfever-2" class="footnote-item"><p>One response to the regressive performance of the sites enumerated here is a version of <em>&quot;they're just holding it wrong; everybody knows you should use Server-Side Rendering (SSR) to paint content quickly&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>Ignoring the factual inaccuracies undergirding SPA apologetics<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/caprock/#fn-spelling-it-out-5" id="fnref-spelling-it-out-5">[5]</a></sup>, the promised approaches (<a href="https://www.builder.io/blog/hydration-is-pure-overhead">&quot;SSR + hydration&quot;</a>, <a href="https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18.html">&quot;concurrent mode&quot;</a>, etc.) <em>have not worked</em>.</p>
<p>We can definitively see they haven't worked because <a href="https://web.dev/blog/inp-cwv-launch">the arrival of INP</a> has shocked the body politic. INP has created a disturbance in the JS ecosystem because, for the first time, it sets a price on main-thread excesses backed by real-world data.</p>
<p>Teams that adopt all these techniques are <a href="https://medium.com/timesopen/enhancing-the-new-york-times-web-performance-with-react-18-d6f91a7c5af8#:~:text=Immediate%20Performance%20Benefits"><em>still</em> are not achieving minimally good results.</a> This is likely why &quot;React Server Components&quot; exists; it represents a last-ditch effort to smuggle some of the most costly aspects of the SPA-based tech stack back to the server where it always belonged.</p>
<p>At the risk of tedious repetition, what these INP numbers mean is that these are <em>bad experiences</em> for <em>real users</em>. And these bad experiences can be laid directly at the feet of tools and architectures that promised <em>better</em> experiences.</p>
<p>Putting the lie to SPA theatrics doesn't require inventing a new, more objective value system. The only petard needed to hoist the React ecosystem into the stratosphere is its own sales pitch, which it has miserably and consistently failed to achieve in practice. <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/caprock/#fnref-hydration-hayfever-2" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-omerta-as-market-failure-3" class="footnote-item"><p>The JavaScript community's omertà regarding the consistent failure of frontend frameworks to deliver reasonable results at acceptable cost is likely to be remembered as one of the most shameful aspects of frontend's lost decade.</p>
<p>Had the risks been prominently signposted, dozens of teams I've worked with personally could have avoided months of painful remediation, and hundreds more sites I've traced could have avoided material revenue losses.</p>
<p>Too many engineering leaders have found their teams beached and unproductive for no reason other than the JavaScript community's dedication to a marketing-over-results ethos of toxic positivity.</p>
<p>Shockingly, cheerleaders for this pattern of failure have not recanted, even when confronted with the consequences. They are not trustworthy. An ethical frontend practice will never arise from this pit of lies and half-truths. New leaders who reject these excesses are needed, and I look forward to supporting their efforts. <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/caprock/#fnref-omerta-as-market-failure-3" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>

<li id="fn-recommendations-4" class="footnote-item"><p>The first steps in remediating JS-based performance disasters are always the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>Audit server configurations, including:
<ul>
<li>Check caching headers and server compression configurations.</li>
<li>Enable HTTP/2 (if not already enabled).</li>
<li>Removing extraneous critical-path connections, e.g. by serving assets from the primary rather than a CDN host.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Audit the contents of the main bundle and remove unneeded or under-used dependencies.</li>
<li>Implement code-splitting and dynamic imports.</li>
<li>Set bundle size budgets and implement CI/CD enforcement.</li>
<li>Form a group of senior engineers to act as a &quot;latency council&quot;.
<ul>
<li>Require the group meet regularly to review key performance metrics.</li>
<li>Charter them to approve all changes that will impact latency.</li>
<li>Have them institute an actionable &quot;IOU&quot; system for short-term latency regression.</li>
<li>Require their collective input when drafting or grading OKRs.</li>

<li id="fn-spelling-it-out-5" class="footnote-item"><p>Apologists for SPA architectures tend to trot out arguments with the form <em>&quot;nobody does X any more&quot;</em> or <em>&quot;everybody knows not to do Y&quot;</em> when facing concrete evidence that sites with <em>active maintenance</em> are doing exactly the things they have recently dissavowed, proving instead that not only are wells uncapped, but the oil slicks aren't even boomed.</p>
<p>It has <em>never</em> been true that in-group disfavour fully contains the spread of once-popular techniques. For chrissake, just look at the CSS-in-JS delusion! This anti-pattern appears in a huge fraction of the traces I look at from <em>new</em> projects today, and that fraction has only gone <em>up</em> since FB hipsters (who were warned directly by browser engineers that it was a terrible idea) finally declared it a terrible idea.</p>
<p>Almost none of today's regretted projects carry disclaimers. None of the frameworks that have led to consistent disasters have posted warnings about their appropriate use. Few boosters for these technologies even outline what <em>they</em> had to do to stop the bleeding (and there is <em>always</em> bleeding) after adopting these complex, expensive, and slow architectures.</p>
<p>Instead, teams are supposed to have followed every twist and turn of inscurtable faddism, spending effort to upgrade huge codebases whenever the new hotness changes.</p>
<p>Of course, when you point out that this is what the apologists are saying, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman">no-true-Scotsmanship</a> unfurls like clockwork.</p>
<p>It's irresponsibility theatre.</p>
<p>Consulting with more than a hundred teams over the past eight years has given me ring-side season tickets to the touring production of this play. The first few performances contained frission, some mystery...but now it's all played out. There's no paradox — the lies by omission are fully revealed, and the workmanlike retelling by each new understudy is as charmless as the last.</p>
<p>All that's left is to pen scathing reviews in the hopes that the tour closes for good. <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/caprock/#fnref-spelling-it-out-5" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>

<p>The first problem is that this site relies on 25 megabytes of JavaScript (uncompressed, 17.4 MB on over the wire) and loads all of it before presenting <em>any</em> content to users.

Users on connections worse than the <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/01/performance-inequality-gap-2024/#test-device-recommendations">P75 baseline</a> emulated here experience excruciating wait times.

<p>As bad as that is, the wait to interact at all is made substantially worse by inept server configuration. Industry-standard gzip compression generally results in 4:1-8:1 data savings for text resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and &quot;other&quot;) depending on file size and contents. That would reduce ~28 megabytes of text, currently served in 19MB of partially compressed resources, to between 3.5MB and 7MB.</p>
<p>But compression is not enabled for most assets, subjecting users to wait for 19MB of content. If CalSAWS built BenefitsCal using progressive enhancement, early HTML and CSS would become interactive while JavaScript filigrees loaded in the background. No such luck for BenefitsCal users on slow connections.</p>

<p>Thanks to the site's JavaScript-dependent, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">client-side rendered, single-page-app (SPA) architecture</a>, nothing is usable until nearly the entire payload is downloaded and run, defeating built-in browser mitigations for slow pages. Had progressive enhancement been employed, even egregious server misconfigurations would have had a muted effect by comparison.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/object-lesson/#fn-bull-in-a-china-shop-5" id="fnref-bull-in-a-china-shop-5">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>Gzip compression has been industry standard on the web for more than 15 years, and <a href="https://github.com/google/brotli">more aggressive algorithms</a> are now available. All <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_compression#Servers_that_support_HTTP_compression">popular web servers</a> support compression, and some <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_deflate.html">enable it by default</a>. It's so common that nearly every web performance testing tool checks for it, including Google's <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/">PageSpeed Insights</a>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/object-lesson/#fn-blockage-6" id="fnref-blockage-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Gzip would have reduced the largest script from 2.1MB to a comparatively svelte 340K; a 6.3x compression ratio:</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">$ <span class="token function">gzip</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-k</span> main.2fcf663c.js <br />$ <span class="token function">ls</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-l</span><br /><span class="token operator">></span> total <span class="token number">2</span>.5M<br /><span class="token operator">></span> <span class="token punctuation">..</span>. <span class="token number">2</span>.1M Aug  <span class="token number">1</span> <span class="token number">17</span>:47 main.2fcf663c.js<br /><span class="token operator">></span> <span class="token punctuation">..</span>. 340K Aug  <span class="token number">1</span> <span class="token number">17</span>:47 main.2fcf663c.js.gz</code></pre>
<p>Not only does the site require a gobsmacking amount of data on first visit, it taxes users nearly the same amount every time they return.</p>
<p>Because most of the site's payload is static, the fraction cached between first and repeat views should be near 100%. BenefitsCal achieves just 7%.</p>
<p>This isn't just perverse; it's <a href="https://web.dev/articles/http-cache">so far out of the norm</a> that I struggled to understand how CalSAWS managed to so thoroughly misconfigure a web server modern enough to support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2">HTTP/2.</a></p>
<p>The answer? Overlooked <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/ServingCompressedFiles.html#compressed-content-cloudfront-configuring">turnkey caching options in CloudFront's dashboard.</a><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/object-lesson/#fn-wtf-amazon-7" id="fnref-wtf-amazon-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>This oversight might have been understandable at launch. The mystery remains how it persisted <a href="https://www.marinhhs.org/sites/default/files/files/servicepages/2021_09/benefitscal_factsheet_0.pdf">for nearly <em>three years</em> (pdf).</a> The slower the device and network, the more sluggish the site feels. Unlike backend slowness, the effects of ambush-by-JavaScript can remain obscured by the fast phones and computers used by managers and developers.</p>
<p>But even if CalSAWS staff never leave the privilege bubble, there has been plenty of feedback:</p>

<p>Because the site is built in a progressively enhanced way, simple fixes can cheaply and quickly improve on an acceptable baseline.</p>
<p>Even today's &quot;slow&quot; networks and phones are so fast that sites can commit almost every kind of classic error and still deliver usable experiences. Sites like WI ACCESS would have felt sluggish just 5 years ago but work fine today. It takes extra effort to screw up as badly as BenefitsCal has.</p>

<p>California <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/04/california-economy-uk-fifth-largest">enjoys a larger GDP</a> and a reputation for technology excellence, and yet the UK consistently outperforms the Golden State's public services.</p>
<p>There are layered reasons for the UK's success:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/">GDS's Service Manual</a> is an enforceable guide for how government services should be built and delivered continuously. This liberates each department from reinventing processes or rediscovering how best to deliver through trial and error.</li>
<li>The GDS Service Manual <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/using-progressive-enhancement"><em>requires</em> progressive-enhancement.</a></li>
<li>Progressive Enhancement is baked into infrastructure and practice by patterns long documented in <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/">the official GDS design system and reference implementation.</a></li>
<li>The parallel <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard">Service Standard</a> clearly articulates the egalitarian, open values that every delivery team is held to.</li>

<p>The BenefitsCal omnishambles should trigger a fundamental rethink. Instead, the prime contractors have <a href="https://insider.govtech.com/california/news/gainwell-technologies-deloitte-get-nod-for-massive-calsaws-contract">just been awarded another $1.3BN</a> over a long time horizon. CalSAWS is now locked in an exclusive arrangement with the very folks that broke the site with JavaScript. Any attempt at fixing it now looks set to reward easily-avoided failure.</p>
<p>Too-big-to-fail procurement isn't just flourishing in California; it's thriving across public benefits application projects nationwide. No matter how badly service delivery is bungled, the money keeps flowing.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.dev/blog/inp-cwv-launch">Core Web Vitals</a> is creating pressure on slow sites that value search engine traffic. It's less clear what effect it will have on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopsony">public-sector monopsonies.</a> The spread of unsafe-at-any-scale JavaScript frameworks into government is worrying as it's hard to imagine what will dislodge them.

<p>Vexingly, whatever hosting infrastructure Massachusetts uses for this project throttles serving to 750KB/s. This bandwidth restriction combines with server misconfigurations to ensure the site takes <em>forever</em> to load, even on fast machines.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/object-lesson/#fn-solidarity-13" id="fnref-solidarity-13">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>It's a small mercy that DTA Connect sets caching headers, allowing repeat visits to load in &quot;only&quot; several seconds. Because of the SPA architecture, nothing renders until <em>all</em> the JavaScript gathers its thoughts at the speed of the local CPU.</p>

<p>Debugging the pathologies of this specific page are beyond the scope of this post, but it is a mystery how New Jersey managed to deploy an application that triggers a <code>debugger;</code> statement on every page load with DevTools open whilst also serving a 1.8MB (13.8MB unzipped) <code>vendor.js</code> file with <em>no minification of any sort</em>.</p>
<p>One wonders if anyone involved in the deployment of this site are developers, and if not, how it exists.</p>

<p>The good news is that not every digital US public benefits portal has been so thoroughly degraded by JavaScript frameworks. Code for America's <a href="https://codeforamerica.org/explore/benefits-enrollment-field-guide/">2023 Benefits Enrollment Field Guide study</a> helpfully ran numbers on many benefits portals, and a spot check shows that those that looked fine last year are generally in decent shape today.</p>
<p>Still, considering just the states examined in this post, one in five US residents will hit underperforming services, should they need them.</p>
<p>None of these sites need to be user hostile. All of them would be significantly faster if states abandoned client-side rendering, along with the legacy JavaScript frameworks (React, Angular, etc.) built to enable the SPA model.</p>
<p>GetCalFresh, Wisconsin, and the UK demonstrate a better future is possible today. To deliver that better future and make it stick, organisations need to learn the limits of their carrying capacity for complexity. They also need to study how different architectures fail in order to select solutions that degrade more gracefully.</p>

  <ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn-receipts-1" class="footnote-item"><p>The JavaScript required to render <em>anything</em> on BenefitsCal embodies nearly every anti-pattern popularised (sometimes inadvertently, but no less predictably) by JavaScript influencers over the past decade, along with the most common pathologies of NPM-based frontend development.</p>
<p>A perusal of the code reveals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple reactive frontend frameworks, namely React, Vue, and RxJS.</li>
<li>&quot;Client-side routing&quot; metadata <em>for the entire site</em> bundled into the main script.</li>
<li>React components for all UI surfaces across the entire site, including:
<ul>
<li>Components for every form, frontloaded. No forms are displayed on the home page.</li>
<li>An entire <a href="https://draftjs.org/">rich-text editing library.</a> No rich-text editing occurs on the home page.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/">complete charting library.</a> No charts appear on the home page.</li>
<li>Sizable custom scrolling and <a href="https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd/tree/master">drag-and-drop libraries.</a> No custom scrolling or drag-and-drop interactions occur on the home page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A so-called &quot;CSS-in-JS&quot; library <a href="https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/blob/main/docs/extract-static.mdx">that does not support compilation to an external stylesheet.</a> This is categorically the slowest and least efficient way to style web-based UIs. On its own, it would justify remediation work.</li>
<li>Unnecessary <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/10/smart-bundling-legacy-code-browsers/">polyfills and transpilation overhead,</a> including:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://caniuse.com/es6-class"><code>class</code> syntax</a> transpilation.</li>
<li><a href="https://caniuse.com/es6-generators">Generator function</a> transpilation and polyfills <em>independently added to dozens of files.</em></li>
<li><a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_builtins_iterator">Iterator transpilation</a> and polyfills.</li>
<li>Standard library polyfills, including obsolete userland implementations of <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_builtins_arraybuffer"><code>ArrayBuffer</code>,</a> <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_builtins_object_assign"><code>Object.assign()</code></a> and repeated inlining of polyfills for many others, including a litany of outdated TypeScript-generated polyfills, bloating every file.</li>
<li>Obselete DOM polyfills, including a copy of Sizzle to provide emulation for <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_element_queryselectorall"><code>document.querySelectorAll()</code></a> and a sizable colourspace conversion system, along with userland easing functions for all animations supported natively by modern CSS.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No fewer than <s>2...wait...5</s>...no, <em>6</em> large — seemingly different! — <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent"><code>User-Agent</code></a> parsing libraries that support browsers as weird and wonderful as WebOS, Obigo, and iCab. What a delightful and unexpected <a href="https://infrequently.org/06/EuroOSCON/MobileAjax.pdf">blast from the past! (pdf)</a></li>
<li>What <em>appears</em> to be an HTML parser and <a href="https://framework7.io/docs/dom7">userland DOM implementation!?!</a></li>
<li>A full copy of <a href="https://underscorejs.org/">Underscore.</a></li>

<li>A <a href="https://github.com/indutny/elliptic">userland elliptic-curve cryptography implementation.</a> Part of an on-page chatbot, naturally.</li>
<li>A full copy of <a href="https://https//momentjs.com//">Moment.js.</a> <em>in addition</em> to the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wojtekmaj/date-utils">custom date and time parsing</a> functions already added via bundling of the (overlarge) <a href="https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-date-picker/"><code>react-date-picker</code> library.</a></li>
<li>An unnecessary <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/sdks/latest/sdks/tutorials/javascript/index.html">OAuth library</a>.</li>
<li>An emulated version of the Node.js <code>buffer</code> class, entirely redundant on modern browsers.</li>
<li>The entire <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/chime/chime-sdk/">Amazon Chime SDK,</a> which includes all the code needed to do videoconferencing. This is loaded in the critical path and alone adds multiple megabytes of JS spread across dozens of webpack-chunked files. No features of the home page appear to trigger videoconferencing.</li>
<li>A full copy of the AWS JavaScript SDK, weighing 2.6MB, served separately.</li>
<li>Obviously, nothing this broken would be complete without a Service Worker <em>that only caches image files</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is, to use the technical term, whack.</p>
<p>The users of BenefitsCal are folks on the margins — often working families — trying to feed, clothe, and find healthcare for kids they want to give a better life. I can think of few groups that would be more poorly served by such baffling product and engineering mismanagement. <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/object-lesson/#fnref-receipts-1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a> <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/object-lesson/#fnref-receipts-1:1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>

<li id="fn-covariate-factors-3" class="footnote-item"><p>Browser engineers sweat the low end because that's where users are<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/object-lesson/#fn-mac-ports-17" id="fnref-mac-ports-17">[17]</a></sup>, and when we do a good job for them, it generally translates into better experiences for everyone else too. One of the most durable lessons of that focus has been that users having a bad time in one dimension are <em>much</em> more likely to be experiencing slowness in others.</p>
<p>Slow networks correlate heavily with older devices that have less RAM, slower disks, and higher taxes from &quot;potentially unwanted software&quot; (PUS). These machines may experience malware fighting with invasive antivirus, slowing disk operations to a crawl. Others may suffer from background tasks for app and OS updates that feel fast on newer machines but which drag on for hours, stealing resources from the user's real work the whole time.</p>
<p>Correlated badness also means that users in these situations benefit from any part of the system using fewer resources. Because browsers are dynamic systems, reduced RAM consumption can make the system faster, both through reduced CPU load from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zram">zram</a>, as well as rebalancing in auto-tuning algorithms to optimise for speed rather than space.</p>
<p>The pursuit of excellent experiences at the margins is deep teacher about the systems we program, and a frequently humbling experience. If you want to become a better programmer or product manager, I recommend focusing on those cases. You'll always learn something. <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/object-lesson/#fnref-covariate-factors-3" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-the-its-an-app-lie-4" class="footnote-item"><p>It's not surprising to see low code coverage percentages on the first load of an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA">SPA</a>. What's shocking is that the developers of BenefitsCal confused it with a site that could benefit from this architecture.</p>
<p>To recap: the bet that SPA-oriented JavaScript frameworks make is that it's <em>possible</em> to deliver better experiences for users when the latency of going to the server can be shortcut by client-side JavaScript.</p>
<p>I cannot stress this enough: the premise of this <em>entire wing</em> of web development practice is that expensive, complex, hard-to-operate, and wicked-to-maintain JavaScript-based UIs lead to <em>better user experiences</em>.</p>
<p>It is more than fair to ask: do they?</p>
<p>In the case of BenefitsCal and DTA Connect, the answer is &quot;no&quot;.</p>
<p>The contingent claim of potentially improved UI requires dividing any additional up-front latency by the number of interactions, then subtracting the average improvement-per-interaction from that total. It's almost impossible to imagine any app with sessions long enough to make 30-second up-front waits worthwhile, never mind a benefits application form.</p>
<p>These projects should never have allowed &quot;frontend frameworks&quot; within a mile of their git repos. That they both picked React (a system with a lurid history of congenital failure) is not surprising, but it is dispiriting.</p>
<p><a href="https://infrequently.org/2022/03/a-unified-theory-of-web-performance/">Previous</a> <a href="https://infrequently.org/2023/02/the-market-for-lemons/">posts</a> here have noted that site structure and critical user journeys largely constrain which architectures make sense:</p>
<figure style="width: 100%;">

  </picture>
  <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
    Sites with short average sessions cannot afford much JS up-front.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>These portals serve many functions: education, account management, benefits signup, and status checks. None of these functions exhibit the sorts of 50+ interaction sessions of a lived-in document editor (Word, Figma) or email client (Gmail, Outlook). They are not &quot;toothbrush&quot; services that folks go to every day, or which they use over long sessions.</p>
<p>Even the sections that might benefit from additional client-side assistance (rich form validation, e.g.) cannot justify loading all of that code up-front for all users.</p>
<p>The failure to recognise how inappropriate JavaScript-based SPA architectures are for most sites is an industry-wide scandal. In the case of these services, that scandal takes on whole new dimension of reckless irresponsibility. <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/object-lesson/#fnref-the-its-an-app-lie-4" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-bull-in-a-china-shop-5" class="footnote-item"><p>JavaScript-based SPAs yank the reins away from the browser while simultaneously frontloading code at the most expensive time.</p>
<p>SPA architectures and the frameworks built to support them put total responsibility for all aspects of site performance squarely on the shoulders of the developer. Site owners who are even occasionally less than omniscient can quickly end up in trouble. It's no wonder many teams I work with are astonished at how quickly these tools lead to disastrous results.</p>
<p>SPAs are &quot;YOLO&quot; for web development.</p>
<p>Their advocates' assumption of developer perfection is reminiscent of C/C++'s approach to memory safety. The predictable consequences should be enough to disqualify them from use in most new work. The sooner these tools and architectures are banned from the public sector, the better. <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/object-lesson/#fnref-bull-in-a-china-shop-5" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>

<li id="fn-blockage-6" class="footnote-item"><p>Confoundingly, while CalSAWS has not figured out how to enable basic caching and compression, it <em>has</em> rolled out firewall rules that prevent many systems like PageSpeed Insights from evaluating the page through IP blocks.</p>
<p>The same rules also prevent access from IPs geolocated to be outside the US. Perhaps it's <em>also</em> a misconfiguration? Surely CalSAWS isn't trying to cut off access to services for users who are temporarialy visiting family in an emergency, right? <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/object-lesson/#fnref-blockage-6" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-wtf-amazon-7" class="footnote-item"><p>There's a lot to say about BenefitsCal's CloudFront configuration debacle.</p>
<p>First, and most obviously: WTF, Amazon?</p>
<p>It's great that these options are single-configuration and easy to find when customers go looking for them, <em>but they should not have to go looking for them.</em> The default for egress-oriented projects should be to enable this and then alert on easily detected double-compression attempts.</p>
<p>Second: WTF, Deloitte?</p>
<p>What sort of C-team are you stringing CalSAWS along with? Y'all should be ashamed. And the taxpayers of California should be looking to claw back funds for obscenely poor service.</p>
<p>Lastly: this is on you, CalSAWS.</p>
<p>As the procurer and approver of delivered work items, the failure to maintain a minimum level of in-house technical skill necessary to call BS on vendors is inexcusable.</p>
<p>New and more appropriate metrics for user success should be integrated into public reporting. That conversation could consume an entire blog post; the current reports are little more than vanity metrics. The state should also redirect money it is spending with vendors to enhance in-house skills in building and maintaining these systems directly.</p>
<p>It's an embarrassment that this site is as broken as it was when I began tracing it three years ago. It's a scandal that good money is being tossed after bad. Do better. <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/object-lesson/#fnref-wtf-amazon-7" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>

<p>I won't attempt nearly as exhaustive inventory of the #fail it contains, but suffice to say, it's a Create React App special. CRAppy, indeed.</p>
<p>Many obsolete polyfills and libraries are bundled, including (but not limited to):</p>

<li>A copy of zlib.js</li>
<li>A full copy of the <a href="https://publicsuffix.org/list/">Public Suffix List</a></li>
<li>A full list of mime types (thousands of lines).</li>
<li>What <em>appears</em> to be a relatively large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table">rainbow table.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Seasoned engineers reading this list may break out in hives, and that's an understandable response. None of this is necessary, and none of it is useful in a modern browser. Yet all of it is in the critical path.</p>
<p>Some truly unbelievable bloat is the result of <em>all</em> localized strings for the entire site occurring in the bundle. In <em>every supported language</em>.</p>
<p>Any text ever presented to the user is included in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, and Vietnamese, adding megabytes to the download.</p>
<p>A careless disregard for users, engineering, and society permeates this artefact. Massachusetts owes citizens better. <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/object-lesson/#fnref-disaster-tourism-14" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>

<li id="fn-mac-ports-17" class="footnote-item"><p>Browsers port to macOS for CEOs, hipster developers, and the tech press.

<p>Wealth-related factors also multiply the visibility of high-end devices (like Macs) in summary statistics. These include better networks and faster hardware, both of which correlate with heavier browsing. Relatively high penetration in geographies with strong web use also helps. For example, Macs have <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272667/market-share-held-by-operating-systems-in-the-us-since-2009/">30% share of desktop-class sales in the US</a>, vs <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/218089/global-market-share-of-windows-7/">15% worldwide.</a>.</p>

This means that smartphones outnumber laptops and desktops to an even greater degree worldwide than they do in the US.</p>
<p>Browser makers keep Linux ports ticking over because that's where developers live (including many of their own). It's also critical for the CI/CD systems that power much of the industry.</p>
<p>Those constituencies are vocal and wealthy, giving them outsized influence. But iOS and and macOS aren't real life; Android and Windows are, particularly their low-end, bloatware-filled expressions.</p>

<hr />
<p>When you live in the shadow of a slow-moving crisis, it's natural to tell people about it. <a href="https://vimeo.com/364402896">At volume.</a> Doubly so when engineers can cheaply and easily address the root causes with minor tweaks. As things worsen, it's also hard not to build empathy for Cassandra.</p>
<p>In late 2011, I moved to London, where the Chrome team was beginning to build Google's first &quot;real&quot; browser for Android.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/the-landscape/#fn-to-each-their-own-1" id="fnref-to-each-their-own-1">[1]</a></sup> The system default <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-3.0-highlights#updated-set-of-standard-apps">Android Browser</a> had, up until that point, been based on the system WebView, locking its rate of progress to the glacial pace of device replacement.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/the-landscape/#fn-familiar-problems-2" id="fnref-familiar-problems-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In a world where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_4">Nexus 4's 2GB of RAM</a> and <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/6112/qualcomms-quadcore-snapdragon-s4-apq8064adreno-320-performance-preview">32-bit, 4-core CPU</a> were the high-end, the memory savings the Android Browser achieved by reusing WebView code mattered immensely.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/the-landscape/#fn-bom-bom-bom-3" id="fnref-bom-bom-bom-3">[3]</a></sup> Those limits presented enormous challenges for Chromium's safer (but memory-hungry) <a href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/multi-process-architecture/">multi-process sandboxing.</a> Android wasn't just spicy Linux; it was an entirely new ballgame.</p>
<p>Even then, it was clear the iPhone wasn't a fluke. Mobile was <em>clearly</em> on track to be the dominant form-factor, and we needed to adapt. Fast.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/the-landscape/#fn-reset-4" id="fnref-reset-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Browsers made that turn, and by 2014, we had made enough progress to consider how the web could participate in mobile's app-based model. This work culminated in <a href="https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/">2015's introduction of PWAs and Push Notifications.</a></p>
<p>Disturbing patterns emerged as we worked with folks building on this new platform. A surprisingly high fraction of them brought slow, desktop-oriented JavaScript frameworks with them to the mobile web. These modern, mobile-first projects neither needed nor could afford the extra bloat frameworks included to paper over the problems of legacy desktop browsers. Web developers needed to adapt the way browser developers had, but consistently failed to hit the mark.</p>
<p>By 2016, frontend practice had fully lapsed into wish-thinking. Alarms were pulled, claxons sounded, but nothing changed.</p>
<p><lite-youtube videoid="4bZvq3nodf4" videotitle="Chrome DevSummit 2016: Progressive Performance"></lite-youtube></p>
<p>It could not have come at a worse time.</p>
<p>By then, explosive growth at the low end was baked into the cake. Billions of feature-phone users had begun to trade up. Different brands endlessly reproduced 2016's mid-tier Androids under a dizzying array of names. The only constants were the middling specs and ever-cheaper prices. Specs that would set punters back $300 in 2016, sold for only $100 a few years later, opening up the internet to hundreds of millions along the way. The battle between the web and apps as the dominant platform was well and truly on.</p>

<p>Prices at the high end accelerated, yet average selling prices remained stuck between $300 and $350. The only way the emergence of the $1K phone didn't bump the average up was the explosive growth at the low end. To keep the average selling price at $325, <em>three</em> $100 low-end phones needed to sell for each $1K iPhone; which is exactly what happened.</p>
<p>And yet, the march of JavaScript-first, framework-centric dogma continued, no matter how incompatible it was with the new reality. Predictably, tools sold on the promise they would deliver &quot;app-like experiences&quot; did anything but.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/the-landscape/#fn-app-like-5" id="fnref-app-like-5">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>It would be tragic if public sector services adopted the JavaScript-heavy stacks that frontend influencers have popularised. Framework-based, &quot;full-stack&quot; development is now the default in Silicon Valley, but should obviously be avoided in universal services. Unwieldy and expensive stacks that have caused agony in the commercial context could never be introduced to the public sector with any hope of success.</p>

<li id="fn-familiar-problems-2" class="footnote-item"><p>Of course, the Chrome team had wanted to build a proper mobile browser sooner, but Android was a paranoid fiefdom separate from Google's engineering culture and systems. And the Android team were <em>intensely</em> suspicious of the web, verging into outright hostility at times.</p>
<p>But internal Google teams kept hitting the limits of what the Android Browser could do, including Search. And when Search says &quot;jump&quot;, the only workable response is &quot;how high?&quot;</p>
<p>WebKit-based though it was (as was Chrome), OS-locked features presented a familiar problem, one the Chrome team had solved with auto-update and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome_Frame">Chrome Frame.</a> A deal was eventually struck, and when Chrome for Android was delivered, the system WebView also became a Chromium-based, multi-process, sandboxed, auto-updating system. For most, that was job done.</p>
<p>This made a certain sort of sense. From the perspective of Google's upper management, Android's role was to put a search box in front of everyone. If letting Andy <em>et al.</em> play around with an unproven Java-based app model was the price, OK. If that didn't work, the web would still be there. If it did, then Google could go from accepting someone else's platform to having one it owned outright.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/the-landscape/#fn-unease-7" id="fnref-unease-7">[7]</a></sup> Win/win.</p>
<p>Anyone trying to suggest a more web-friendly path for Android got shut down <em>hard</em>. The Android team always had legitimate system health concerns that they could use as cudgels, and they weilded them with abandon.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/">launch of PWAs in 2015</a> was an outcome Android saw coming a mile away and worked hard to prevent. But that's a story for another day. <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/the-landscape/#fnref-familiar-problems-2" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-bom-bom-bom-3" class="footnote-item"><p>Android devices were already being spec'd with more RAM than contemporary iPhones, thanks to Dalvik's chonkyness. This, in turn, forced many OEMs to cut corners in other areas, including slower CPUs.</p>
<p>This effect has been a silent looming factor in the past decade's divergence in CPU performance between top-end Android and iPhones. Not only did Android OEMs have to pay a distinct profit margin to Qualcomm for their chips, but they also had to dip into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_materials">Bill Of Materials (BOM)</a> budget to afford more memory to keep things working well, leaving less for the CPU.</p>
<p>Conversely, Apple's relative skimpiness on memory and burning desire to keep BOM costs low for parts it doesn't manufacture are reasons to oppose browser engine choice. If real browsers were allowed, end users might expect phones with decent specs. Apple keeps that in check, in part, by maximising <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_cache">code page reuse</a> across browsers and apps that are forced to use the system WebView.</p>
<p>That might dig into margins <em>ever so slightly</em>, and we can't have that, can we? <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/the-landscape/#fnref-bom-bom-bom-3" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-reset-4" class="footnote-item"><p>It took browsers that were originally architected in a desktop-only world many years to digest the radically different hardware that mobile evolved. Not only were CPU speeds and memory budgets cut dramatically — nevermind the need to port to ARM, including JS engine JITs that were heavily optimised for x86 — but networks suddenly became intermittent and variable-latency.</p>
<p>There were also upsides. Where GPUs had been rare on the desktop, every phone had a GPU. Mobile CPUs were slow enough that what had felt like a leisurely walk away from CPU-based rendering on desktop became an absolute necessity on phones. Similar stories played out across input devices, sensors, and storage.</p>
<p>It's no exaggeration to say that the transition to mobile force-evolved browsers in a compressed time frame. If only websites had made the same transition. <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/the-landscape/#fnref-reset-4" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-app-like-5" class="footnote-item"><p>Let's take a minute to unpack what the JavaScript framework claims of <em>&quot;app-like experiences&quot;</em> were meant to convey.</p>
<p>These were code words for more responsive UI, building on the Ajax momentum of the mid-naughties. Many boosters claimed this explicitly and built <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/">popular tools to support these specific architectures.</a></p>
<p>As we wander through the burning wreckage of public services that adopted these technologies, remember one thing: they were supposed to make UIs <em>better</em>. <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/the-landscape/#fnref-app-like-5" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-performance-isnt-everything-6" class="footnote-item"><p>When confronted with nearly unusable results from tools sold on the idea that they make sites easier, better, and faster to use, many technologists offer the variants of <em>&quot;but at least it's online!&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;it's fast enough for most people&quot;</em>. The most insipid version implies causality, constructing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximate_cause">strawman <em>but-for</em> defense;</a> <em>&quot;but these sites might not have even been built without these frameworks.&quot;</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/the-landscape/#fn-cruelly-stupid-9" id="fnref-cruelly-stupid-9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>These points can be both true and immaterial at the same time. It isn't necessary for poor performance to <em>entirely</em> exclude folks at the margins for it to be a significant disincentive to accessing services.</p>
<p>We know this because it has been proven and continually reconfirmed in <a href="https://wpostats.com/">commercial</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/opinion/sunday/why-waiting-in-line-is-torture.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Bk4.c_y7.EhyNmle0_aTb&amp;smid=url-share">lab</a> settings. <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/the-landscape/#fnref-performance-isnt-everything-6" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-unease-7" class="footnote-item"><p>The web is unattractive to every Big Tech company in a hurry, even the ones that owe their existence to it.</p>
<p>The web's joint custody arrangement rankles. The standards process is inscrutable and frustrating to PMs and engineering managers who have only ever had to build technology inside one company's walls. Playing on hard mode is unappealing to high-achievers who are used to running up the score.</p>
<p>And then there's the technical prejudice. The web's languages offend &quot;serious&quot; computer scientists. In the <a href="https://xkcd.com/378/">bullshit hierarchy</a> of programming language snobbery, <em>everyone</em> looks down on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (in that order).</p>
<p>The web's <em>overwhelmingly</em> successful languages present a paradox: for the comfort of the snob, they must simultaneously be unserious toys beneath the elevated palettes of &quot;generalists&quot; and also Gordian Knots too hard for anyone to possibly wield effectively. This dual posture justifies treating frontend as a less-than discipline, and browsers as anything but a serious application platform.</p>
<p>This isn't universal, but it is common, particularly in Google's C++/Java-pilled upper ranks.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/the-landscape/#fn-self-limiting-8" id="fnref-self-limiting-8">[8]</a></sup> Endless budgetary space for projects like the Android Framework, Dart, and Flutter were the result. <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/the-landscape/#fnref-unease-7" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-self-limiting-8" class="footnote-item"><p>Someday I'll write up the tale of how Google so thoroughly devalued frontend work that it couldn't even retain the <em>unbelievably</em> good web folks it hired in the mid-'00s. Their inevitable departures after years of being condescended to went hand-in-hand with an inability to hire replacements.</p>
<p>Suffice to say, by the mid '10s, things were <em>bad</em>. So bad an exec finally noticed. This created a bit of space to fix it. A team of volunteers answered the call, and for more than a year we met to rework recruiting processes and collateral, interview loop structures, interview questions, and promotion ladder criteria.</p>
<p>The hope was that folks who work in the cramped confines of someone else's computer could finally be recognised for their achievements. And for a few years, Google's frontends got markedly better.</p>
<p>I'm told the mean has reasserted itself. Prejudice is an insidious thing. <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/the-landscape/#fnref-self-limiting-8" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-cruelly-stupid-9" class="footnote-item"><p>The <em>but-for</em> defense for underperforming frontend frameworks requires us to ignore both the 20 years of web development practice that preceeded these tools <em>and</em> the higher OpEx and CapEx costs associated with React-based stacks.</p>
<p>Managers sometimes offer a hireability argument, suggesting they need to adopt these univerally more expensive and harder to operate tools <em>because they need to be able to hire</em>. This was always nonsense, but never more so than in 2024. Some of the best, most talented frontenders I know are looking for work and would <em>leap</em> at the chance to do good things in an organisation that puts user experience first.</p>
<p>Others sometimes offer the idea that it would be too hard to retrain their teams. Often, these are engineering groups comprised of folks who recently retrained from other stacks to the new React hotness or who graduated boot camps armed only with these tools. The idea that either cohort cannot learn anything else is as inane as it is self-limiting.</p>
<p>Frontenders can learn any framework and are constantly retraining just to stay on <a href="https://polotek.net/posts/the-frontend-treadmill/">the treadmill.</a> The idea that there are savings to be had in <em>&quot;following the herd&quot;</em> into Next.js or similar JS-first development cul-de-sacs has to meet an evidentiary burden that I have rarely seen teams clear.</p>
<p>Managers who want to avoid these messes have options.</p>
<p>First, they can <a href="https://kellanem.com/notes/new-tech">crib Kellan's tests for new technologies.</a> Extra points for <a href="https://blog.glyph.im/2024/07/against-innovation-tokens.html">digesting Glyph's thoughts on &quot;innovation tokens.&quot;</a></p>
<p>Next, they should identify the critical user journeys in their products. Technology choices are always situated in product constraints, but until the critical user journeys are enunciated, the selection of <em>any</em> specific architecture is likely to be wrong.</p>
<p>Lastly, they should always run bakeoffs. Once critical user journeys are outlined and agreed, bakeoffs can provide teams with essential data about how different technology options will perform under those conditions. For frontend technologies, that means evaluating them under <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/01/performance-inequality-gap-2024/">representative market conditions.</a></p>
<p>And yes, there's almost always time to do several small prototypes. It's a damn sight cheaper than the months (or years) of painful remediation work. I'm sick to death of having to hand-hold teams whose products are suffocating under unusably large piles of cruft, slowly nursing their  code-bases back to something like health as their management belatedely <a href="https://infrequently.org/2022/05/performance-management-maturity/">learns the value of knowing their systems deeply.</a></p>
<p>Managers that do honest, user-focused bakeoffs for their frontend choices can avoid adding their teams to the dozens I've consulted with who adopted extremely popular, fundamentally inappropriate technologies that have had disasterous effects on their businesses and team velocity. Discarding popular stacks from consideration through evidence isn't a career risk; it's literally the reason to hire engineers and engineering leaders in the first place. <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/the-landscape/#fnref-cruelly-stupid-9" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>

<p>So why am I dissapointed in the TAG, given that my position is essentially what they wrote? Because it failed to acknowledge the limited and contingent upside of removing third-party cookies, or the thorny issues we're left with after they're gone.</p>
<h2 id="unmasking-the-problem">Unmasking The Problem <a class="permalink" href="https://infrequently.org/2024/07/misfire/#unmasking-the-problem">#</a></h2>
<p>So, what do third-party cookies do? And how do they relate to the privacy theat model?</p>
<p>Like a lot of web technology, third-party cookies have both positive and negative uses. Owing to a historcal lack of platform-level identity APIs, they form the backbone of nearly every large Single Sign-On (SSO) system. Thankfully, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FedCM_API">replacements have been developed and are being iterated on</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some browsers have <a href="https://support.okta.com/help/s/article/FAQ-How-Blocking-Third-Party-Cookies-Can-Potentially-Impact-Your-Okta-Environment?language=en_US">unilaterally removed them without developing such replacements, disrupting sign-in flows across the web,</a> harming users and pushing businesses toward native mobile apps. That's bad, as native apps face no limits on communicating with third parties and are generally worse for tracking. They're not even subject to pro-user interventions like browser extensions. The TAG should have called out this aspect of the current debate in its Finding, encouraging vendors to adopt APIs that will make the transition smoother.</p>
<p>The creepy uses of third-party cookies relate to advertising. Third-party cookies provide ad networks and data brokers the ability to silently reidentify users as they browse the web. Some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_profile">build &quot;shadow profiles&quot;</a>, and most target ads based on sites users visit. This targeting is at the core of the debate around third-party cookies.</p>
<p>Adtech companies like to claim targeting based on these dossiers allows them to put ads in front of users most likely to buy, reducing wasted ad spending. The industry even has a shorthand: <em>&quot;right people, right time, right place.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Despite the bold claims and a consensus that &quot;targeting works,&quot; there's reason <a href="https://www.mi-3.com.au/18-06-2024/ex-um-privacy-chief-lifts-lid-google-has-captured-trade-associations-and-holdcos">to believe pervasive surveillence doesn't deliver,</a> and even when it does, <a href="https://www.mi-3.com.au/26-06-2024/data-delusion-does-using-data-target-specific-audiences-advertising-actually-make">isn't more effective.</a></p>
<p>Assuming the social utility of targeted ads is low — likely <em>much</em> lower than adtech firms claim — shouldn't we support the TAG's finding? Sadly, no. The TAG missed a critical opportunity to call for legislative fixes to the technically unfixable problems it failed to enumerate.</p>
<p>Privacy isn't just about collection, it's about correlation across time. Adtech can and will migrate to the server-side, meaning publishers will become active participants in tracking, funneling data back to ad networks directly from their own logs. Targeting pipelines will still work, with the largest adtech vendors consolidating market share in the process.</p>
<p>This is why <em>&quot;give us your email address for 30% discount&quot;</em> popups and account signup forms are suddenly everywhere. Email addresses are stable, long-lived reidentifiers. Overt mechanisms like this are already replacing third-party cookies. Make no mistake: post-removal, tracking will continue for as long as reidentification has perceived positive economic value. The only way to change that equation is legislation; anything else is a band-aid.</p>
<p>Pulling tracking out of the shadows is good, but a limited and contingent good. Users have a <em>terrible</em> time recognising and mitigating risk on the multi-month time-scales where privacy invasions play out. There's virtually no way to control or predict where collected data will end up in most jurisdictions, and long-term collection gets cheaper by the day.</p>
<p>Once correlates are established, or &quot;consent&quot; is given to process data in ways that facilitate unmasking, re-identification becomes trivial. It only takes giving a phone number to one delivery company, or an email address to one e-commerce site to suddenly light up a shadow profile, linking a vast amount of previously un-attributed browsing to a user. Clearing caches can reset things for a little while, but any tracking vendor that can observe a large proportion of browsing will eventually be able to join things back up.</p>
<p>Removal of third-party cookies <em>can</em> temporarily disrupt this reidentification while collection funnels are rebuilt to use &quot;first party&quot; data, but that's not going to improve the situation over the long haul. The problem isn't just what's being collected <em>now</em>, it's the ocean of dormant data that was previously slurped up.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/07/misfire/#fn-a-digression-on-native-apps-3" id="fnref-a-digression-on-native-apps-3">[3]</a></sup> The only way to avoid pervasive collection and reidentification over the long term is to change the economics of correlation.</p>
<p>The TAG surely understands the only way to make that happen is for more jurisdictions to pass privacy laws worth a damn. It should say so.</p>
<h2 id="fire-and-movement">Fire And Movement <a class="permalink" href="https://infrequently.org/2024/07/misfire/#fire-and-movement">#</a></h2>
<p>The goal of tracking is to pick users out of crowds, or at least bucket them into small unique clusters. As <a href="https://toot.cafe/@slightlyoff/112870912050930748">I explained on Mastodon</a>, this boils down to bits of entropy, and <a href="https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/">those bits are <em>everywhere</em>.</a> From screen resolution and pixel density, to the intrinsic properties of the networks, to extensions, to language and accessibility settings that folks rely on to make browsing liveable. Every attribute that is even subtly different can be a building block for silent reidentification; A.K.A., &quot;fingerprinting.&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/07/misfire/#fn-a-truly-private-browser-4" id="fnref-a-truly-private-browser-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>In jurisdictions where laws allow collected data to remain the property of the collector, the risks posed by data-at-rest is only slightly attenuated by narrowing the funnel through which collection takes place.</p>
<p>It's possible to imagine computing that isn't fingerprintable, but that isn't what anyone is selling. For complex reasons, even the most cautious use of commodity computers is likely to be uniquely identifiable with enough time. This means that the question to answer isn't <em>&quot;do we think tracking is bad?&quot;</em>, it's <em>&quot;given that we can't technically eliminate it, how can we rebuild privacy?&quot;</em>. The TAG's new Finding doesn't wrestle with that question, doing the community a disservice in the process.</p>
<p>The most third-party cookie removal can deliver is temporary disruption. That disruption will affect distasteful collectors, costing them money in the short run. Many think of this as a win, I suspect because they fail to think through the longer-term consequences. The predictable effect will be a recalibration and entrenchment of surveillence methods. It will not put the panopticon out of business; only laws can do that.</p>
<p>For a preview of what this will look like, think back on Apple's <a href="https://mobiledevmemo.com/apple-robbed-the-mobs-bank/">&quot;App Tracking Transparency&quot;</a> kayfabe, <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/facebook-statistics/">which did not visibly dent Facebook's long-term profits.</a></p>
<p>So this is not a solution to privacy, it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_and_movement">fire-and-movement tactics</a> against corporate enemies. Because of the deep technical challenges in defeating fingerprinting<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/07/misfire/#fn-a-truly-private-browser-4" id="fnref-a-truly-private-browser-4:1">[4:1]</a></sup>, even the most outspoken vendors have given up, <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/labels/">introducing &quot;nutrition labels&quot; to shift responsibility for privacy onto consumers.</a></p>
<p>If the best vertically-integrated native ecosystems can do is to shift blame, the TAG should call out posturing about ineffective changes and push for real solutions. Vendors should loudly lobby for stronger laws that can truly change the game and the TAG should join those calls. The TAG should also advocate for the web, rather than playing into technically ungrounded fearmongering by folks trying to lock users into proprietary native apps whilst <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/apple-browser-ban/">simultaneously depriving users of more private browsers.</a></p>
<h2 id="finding-a-way-forward">Finding A Way Forward <a class="permalink" href="https://infrequently.org/2024/07/misfire/#finding-a-way-forward">#</a></h2>
<p>The most generous take I can muster is that the TAG's work is half-done. Calling on vendors to drop third-party cookies has the virtue of being technical and actionable, properties I believe all TAG writing should embody.  But having looked deeply at the situation, the TAG should have also called on browser vendors to support further reform along several axes — particularly vendors that also make native OSes.</p>
<p>First, if the TAG is serious about preventing tracking and improving the web ecosystem, it should call on all OS vendors <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/in-app-browsers-the-worst-erosion-of-user-choice-you-havent-heard-of/">to prohibit the use of &quot;in-app browsers&quot;</a> when displaying third-party content within native apps.</p>
<p>It is not sufficient to <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/10882/app-bound-domains/">prevent JavaScript injection</a> because the largest native apps can simply convince the sites to include their scripts directly. For browser-based tracking attenuation to be effective, these side-doors must be closed. Firms grandstanding about browser privacy features without ensuring users can reliably enjoy the protections of their browser need to do better. The TAG is uniquely positioned to call for this erosion of privacy and the web ecosystem to end.</p>
<p>Next, the TAG should have outlined the limits of technical approaches to attenuating data collection. It should also call on browser vendors to adopt scale-based interventions (rather than <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-declined-to-implement-16-web-apis-in-safari-due-to-privacy-concerns/">absolutism</a>) in mitigating high-entropy API use.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/07/misfire/#fn-but-does-it-scale-5" id="fnref-but-does-it-scale-5">[5]</a></sup> The TAG should go first in moving past debates that don't acknowledge impossibilities in removing all reidentification, and encourage vendors to do the same. There's no solution to the privacy puzzle that can be solved by the purchase of a new phone, and the TAG should be clarion about what <em>will</em> end our privacy nightmare: privacy laws worth a damn.</p>
<p>Lastly, the TAG should highlight discrepancies between privacy marketing and the failure of vendors to push for strong privacy laws and enforcement. Because the threat model of privacy intrusion renders solely techincal interventions ineffective on long timeframes, this is the rare case in which the TAG should push past providing technical advice.</p>
<p>The TAG's role is to explain complex things with rigor and signpost credible ways forward. It has not done that yet regarding third-party cookies, but it's not too late.</p>

<p>A balanced finding would call on Apple to stop stonewalling the technologies needed to bring users to safer waters, <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=beforeinstallprompt">including PWA installation prompts.</a> <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/07/misfire/#fnref-a-digression-on-native-apps-3" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-a-truly-private-browser-4" class="footnote-item"><p>As part of the drafting of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/unsanctioned-tracking/">2015 finding on Unsanctioned Web Tracking</a>, the then-TAG (myself included) spent a great deal of time working through the details of potential fingerprinting vectors. What we came to realise was that only the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor Browser</a> had done the work to credibly analyise fingerprinting vectors and produce a coherent threat model. To the best of my knowledge, that remains true today.</p>
<p>Other vendors continue to publish <a href="https://webkit.org/tracking-prevention-policy/">gussied-up marketing documents</a> and <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/15697/private-browsing-2-0/">stroppy blog posts</a> that purport to cover the same ground, but consistently fail to do so. It's <em>truly</em> objectionable that those same vendors also prevent users from chosing disciplined privacy-focused browsers.</p>
<p>To understand the difference, we can do a small thought experiment, enumerating what would be necessary to sand off currently-identifiable attributes of individual users. Because only 31 or 32 bits are needed to uniquely identify anybody (often less), we want a high safety factor. This means bundling users into very large crowds by removing distinct observable properties. To sand off variations between users, a truly private browser might:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run the entire browser in a VM in order to:
<ul>
<li>Cap the number of CPU cores, frequency, and centralise on a single instruction set (e.g., emulating ARM when running on x86). Will likely result in a 2-5x slowdown.</li>
<li>Ensure (high) fixed latency for all disk access.</li>
<li>Set a uniform (low) cap on total memory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Disable hardware acceleration for all graphics and media.</li>
<li>Disable JIT. Will slow JavaScript by 3-10x.</li>
<li>Only allow a fixed set of fonts, screen sizes, pixel densities, gamuts, and refresh rates; no more resizing browsers with a mouse. The web will pixelated and drab and animations will feel choppy.</li>
<li>Remove most accessibility settings.</li>
<li>Remove the ability to install extensions.</li>
<li>Eliminate direct typing and touch-based interactions, as those can leak timing information that's unique.</li>
<li>Run all traffic through Tor or a similarly high-latency VPN egress nodes.</li>
<li>Disable all reidentifying APIs (no more web-based video conferencing!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Only the Tor project is shipping a browser anything like this today, and it's how you can tell that most of what passes for &quot;privacy&quot; features in other browsers are anti-annoyance and anti-creep-factor interventions; they matter, but won't end the digital panopticon. <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/07/misfire/#fnref-a-truly-private-browser-4" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a> <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/07/misfire/#fnref-a-truly-private-browser-4:1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>

<li id="fn-but-does-it-scale-5" class="footnote-item"><p>It's not a problem that sign-in flows need third-party cookies today, but it <em>is</em> a problem that they're used for pervasive tracking.</p>
<p>Likewise, the privacy problems inherent in email collection or camera access or filesystem folders aren't absolute, they're related to scale of use. There are important use-cases that demand these features, and computers aren't going to stop supporting them. This means the debate is only whether or not users can use the web to meet those needs. Folks who push an absolutist line are, in effect, working against the web's success. This is anti-user, as the alternatives are generally much more invasive native apps.</p>
<p>Privacy problems arise at scale and across time. Browsers should be doing more to discourage high-quality reidentifiaction across cache clearing and in ways that escalate with risk. The first site you grant camera access isn't the issue; it's the 10th. Similarly, speed bumps should be put in place for use of reidentifying APIs on sites across cache clearing where possible.</p>
<p>The TAG can be instrumental is calling for this sort of change in approach. <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/07/misfire/#fnref-but-does-it-scale-5" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
