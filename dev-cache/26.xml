      <description>&lt;p&gt;In November of last year, I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://drewdevault.com/2023/11/25/2023-11-26-RMS-on-sex.html&#34;&gt;Richard Stallman&amp;rsquo;s political discourse on
sex&lt;/a&gt;, which argues that Richard Stallman, the founder of and present-day
voting member of the board of directors of the Free Software Foundation (FSF),
endorses and advocates for a harmful political agenda which legitimizes
adult attraction to minors, consistently defends adults accused of and
convicted of sexual crimes with respect to minors, and more generally
erodes norms of consent and manipulates language regarding sexual harassment and
sexual assault in his broader political program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to this article, and on many occasions when I have re-iterated my
position on Stallman in other contexts, a common response is to assert that my
calls to censure Stallman are ableist, on the basis that Stallman is
neurodivergent (ND). This line of reasoning suggests that Stallman&amp;rsquo;s awkward and
zealous views on sex are in line with his awkward and zealous positions on other
matters (such as his insistence on &amp;ldquo;GNU/Linux&amp;rdquo; terminology rather than &amp;ldquo;Linux&amp;rdquo;),
and that together this illustrates a pattern which suggests neurodivergence is
at play. This argumentation is flawed, but I think it presents us with a good
opportunity to talk about how neurodivergence and sexism presents in our
community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurodivergence (antonymous with &amp;ldquo;neurotypical&amp;rdquo;) is an umbrella term that
encompasses a wide variety of human experiences, including autism, ADHD,
personality disorders, bipolar disorder, and others. The particular claims I&amp;rsquo;ve
heard about Stallman suggest that he is &amp;ldquo;obviously&amp;rdquo; autistic, or has &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome&#34;&gt;Asperger
syndrome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The allegation of ableism in my criticisms of Stallman
are rooted in this presumption of neurodivergence in Stallman: the argument goes
that I am putting his awkwardness on display and mocking him for it, that
calling for the expulsion of someone on the basis of being awkward is ableist,
and that this has a chilling effect on our community, which is generally thought
to have a high incidence of neurodivergence. I will respond to this defense of
Stallman today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A defense of problematic behavior that cites neurodivergence to not only
explain, but excuse, said behavior, is ableist and harms neurodivergent people,
rather than standing up for them as these arguments portray themselves as doing.
To illustrate this, I opened a discussion on the Fediverse asking neurodivergent
people to chime in and reached out directly to some ND friends in my social
circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;aside-is-stallman-neurodivergent&#34;&gt;Aside: Is Stallman neurodivergent?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stallman&amp;rsquo;s neurodivergence is an unsolicited armchair diagnosis with no
supporting evidence besides &amp;ldquo;vibes&amp;rdquo;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.computerworld.com/article/1683286/asperger-s-oxymoron.html&#34;&gt;This 2008 article&lt;/a&gt; summarizes his
public statements on the subject:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During a 2000 profile for the Toronto Star, Stallman described himself to an
interviewer as ‘borderline autistic,’ a description that goes a long way
toward explaining a lifelong tendency toward social and emotional isolation
and the equally lifelong effort to overcome it,” Williams wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I cited that excerpt from the book during the interview, Stallman said
that assessment was “exaggerated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wonder about it, but that’s as far as it goes,” he said. “Now, it’s clear I
do not have [Asperger’s] — I don’t have most of the characteristics of that.
For instance, one of those characteristics is having trouble with rhythm. I
love the most complicated, fascinating rhythms.” But Stallman did acknowledge
that he has “a few of the characteristics” and that he “might have what some
people call a ‘shadow’ version of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theory that Stallman is neurodivergent is usually cited to explain his
various off-putting behaviors, but there is no tangible evidence to support the
theory. This alone raises some alarms, in that off-putting behavior is
sufficient evidence to presume neurodivergence. I agree that some of his
behavior, off-putting or otherwise, appears consistent, to my untrained eye,
with some of the symptoms of autism. Nevertheless I am not going to forward an
armchair diagnosis in either direction. However, because a defense of Stallman
on the basis of neurodivergence is contingent on him being neurodivergent, this
rest of this article will presume that it is true for the purpose of rebuttal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;: we don&amp;rsquo;t know and the assumption that he is is ableist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This defense of Stallman is ableist because it infantalizes and denies agency
to neurodivergent people. Consider what&amp;rsquo;s being said here: it only follows
that Stallman&amp;rsquo;s repugnant behavior is excusable because he&amp;rsquo;s neurodivergent if
neurodivergent people cannot help but be repugnant. An autistic person I spoke
to, who wishes to remain anonymous, had the following to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an autistic person, I find these statements deeply offensive, because they
build on and perpetuate damaging stereotypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research has repeatedly proved that, on average, autistic folks have high
empathy and a higher sense of values than the general population. We are not
the emotionless robots that the popular imagination believes we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we are not a monolith, and some autistic folks are absolute assholes who
should be called out (and held accountable) for the harm that they cause.
Autism is context, not an excuse: it can explain why someone might struggle in
some situations and need additional support, but it should never be an excuse
to harm others. We can all learn and improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have witnessed people pulling the autism card to avoid consequences for CoC
violations, then calling out the organization for &amp;ldquo;not supporting true
diversity&amp;rdquo; when they&amp;rsquo;re shown the door. This is manipulative and insulting to
the other neurodivergent members of the community, and should never be
tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bram Dingelstad, a neurodivergent person who participated in the discussion, had
this to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problematic behaviour is what it is: problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of neurodivergent people out there that are able to carry
themselves in a way that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make anyone unsafe or harm victims of sexual
assault by dismissing or downplaying their lived experience. In my opinion,
using neurodivergence as an excuse for this behaviour only worsens the
perception of neurodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Stallman should be held accountable for his speech and his actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another commenter put it more concisely, if not as eloquently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s fucking ableist to say neurodiversity disposes you towards problematic
behaviors. It&amp;rsquo;s disgusting trying to hide behind it and really quite
insulting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came away from these discussions with the following understanding:
neurodivergence, in particular autism, causes people to struggle to understand
unstated social norms and conventions, sometimes with embarrassing or harmful
consequences, such as with respect to interpersonal relationships. The people
I&amp;rsquo;ve spoken to call for empathy and understanding in the mistakes which can be
made in light of this, but also call for accountability &amp;ndash; to be shown
what&amp;rsquo;s right (and, importantly, &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it&amp;rsquo;s so), and then to be expected to
behave accordingly, no different from anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being neurodivergent doesn&amp;rsquo;t make someone sexist, but it can make it harder for
them to hide sexist views. To associate Stallman&amp;rsquo;s sexism with his perceived
neurodivergence is ableist, and to hold Stallman accountable for his behavior is
not. One commenter puts it this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve said quite a few times is that sexism is not a symptom of autism. Writing
this sort of behaviour off as &amp;ldquo;caused by&amp;rdquo; neurodivergence is itself ableist,
I&amp;rsquo;m not a huge fan of the narrative that I have &amp;ldquo;the neurodevelopmental
disorder that makes you a bigot&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fundamentally disagree with the idea that the pervasive sexism in tech
is because of the high incidence of neurodiversity. It&amp;rsquo;s because tech has
broadly operated as a boys club for decades, and those norms persist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using neurodivergence as a cover for sexism and problematic behavior in our
communities is a toxic, ableist, and, of course, sexist attitude that serves to
provide problematic men with space to be problematic. Note also how
intersections between neurodiversity and identity play out: white men tend to be
excused on the basis of neurodivergence, whereas for women, transgender people,
people of color, etc &amp;ndash; the excuse does not apply. Consider the differences in
how bipolar disorder is perceived in women &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;she&amp;rsquo;s crazy&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; versus how men
with autism are accommodated &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;he can&amp;rsquo;t help it&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I reject the notion that it is ableist to criticize problematic behavior
that can be explained by neurodivergence. But, even if it were, an anonymous
autistic commenter has this to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we accept the hypothesis that it is ableist to condemn behavior which can
be explained by neurodivergence (and I don&amp;rsquo;t), my answer is: be ableist. I
don&amp;rsquo;t like it, but it&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous to imagine any other option in the physical
world, and it&amp;rsquo;s weird to treat the virtual world so differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an anecdote: when I was at school, a new person, Adam, joined the
class. We didn&amp;rsquo;t want Adam to feel excluded, so we included him in our
social events. Adam had narcissistic personality disorder, and likely in part
because of this, he was also a serial harasser of women. So what did we do
about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stopped inviting Adam. I wish we didn&amp;rsquo;t have to stop inviting him, but our
hands were tied. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to say it&amp;rsquo;s something only he could change,
because maybe he truly couldn&amp;rsquo;t change that. Maybe it was ableist to exclude
him. But the safety of my friends comes first. The hard part is distinguishing
between this situation and a situation where someone is excluded when they are
perceived as a threat just because they&amp;rsquo;re different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stallman&amp;rsquo;s rhetoric and behavior are harmful, and we need to address that harm.
The refrain of &amp;ldquo;criticizing Stallman&amp;rsquo;s behavior is ableist and alienates
neurodiverse individuals in our community&amp;rdquo; is itself ableist and isn&amp;rsquo;t doing any
favors for our neurodiverse friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude this article, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d take this opportunity to find out what
our neurodiverse friends are actually struggling with and how we can better
accommodate their needs in our community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, a recognition of individuals as being autonomous, independent
people with agency and independent needs has to come first, with neurodiversity
and with everything else. Listen to people when they explain their experiences
and their needs as individuals, and don&amp;rsquo;t rely on romanticized and stereotypical
understandings of particular neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism. These
stereotypes are often deeply harmful: one person spoke of being accused of
incompetence and lying about their neurodivergence in a ploy for sympathy. They
experienced severe harassment, at the worst in the form of harassers engineering
stressful situations and screenshoting their reactions to humiliate them and
damage their reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standing up for your peers is important, in this as in all things. Not only
against harassment, discrimination, and abuse on the basis of neurodivergence,
but on any basis, from any person &amp;ndash; which I was often reminded is especially
important for neurodivergent people who are not cishet white men, as these
challenges are amplified in light of these intersectional identities. Talk to
people and understand their experiences, their needs, and their worldview. Be
patient, but clear and open in your communication. The neurodivergent people I
spoke to often found it difficult to learn social mores, moreso than most
neurotypical experiences, but nevertheless the vast majority of them felt
perfectly capable of it, and the expectation that they weren&amp;rsquo;t is demeaning and
ableist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also heard some advice from the neurodivergent community that applies
especially to free software community leaders. Clearly stated community norms
and expectations, through codes of conducts and visible moderation, is often
helpful for neurodivergent people. Many ND people struggle to intuit or &amp;ldquo;guess&amp;rdquo;
social norms and prefer expectations to be stated unambiguously. Normalizing the
use of tone indicators (e.g. &amp;ldquo;/s&amp;rdquo;), questions clarifying intent, and conflict
de-escalation are also good tools to employ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another consideration of merit is accommodations for asynchronous participation
in meaningful governance and decision-making processes. Some ND people find it
difficult to participate in real-time discussions in chat rooms or in person,
and mediums like emails and other long-form slow discussions are easier for them
to engage with. Accommodations for sensory sensitivities at in-person events is
another good strategy to include more ND folks in your event. Establishing quiet
spaces to get away from the busier parts of the event, being considerate of
lighting choices, flexible break times, and activities for smaller groups were
all highlighted to me by ND people as making their experience more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the lessons I took away from speaking to dozens of neurodivergent
people in researching this blog post. I encourage you to speak to, and listen
to, people in your communities as well, particularly when dealing with an issue
which cites their struggles or impacts them directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth mentioning that Asperger&amp;rsquo;s syndrome is a
now-discredited diagnosis which has been deprecated in favor of a broader
understanding of autism. Hans Asperger was a Nazi eugenicist who referred
children he diagnosed to Am Spiegelgrund clinic, where hundreds of children
were murdered by Nazi Germany during World War II.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Rust for Linux revisited</title>
      <link>https://drewdevault.com/2024/08/30/2024-08-30-Rust-in-Linux-revisited.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 30 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://drewdevault.com/2024/08/30/2024-08-30-Rust-in-Linux-revisited.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ugh. Drew&amp;rsquo;s blogging about Rust again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; You&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I promise to be nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, seeing the Rust-for-Linux project starting to get the ball
rolling, I wrote &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://drewdevault.com/2022/10/03/Does-Rust-belong-in-Linux.html&#34;&gt;Does Rust belong in the Linux kernel?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, penning a
conclusion consistent with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge&#39;s_law_of_headlines&#34;&gt;Betteridge&amp;rsquo;s law of headlines&lt;/a&gt;. Two years on we
have a lot of experience to draw on to see how Rust-for-Linux is actually playing
out, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to renew my thoughts with some hindsight &amp;ndash; and more
compassion. If you&amp;rsquo;re one of the Rust-for-Linux participants burned out or
burning out on this project, I want to help. Burnout sucks &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;ve been there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people working on Rust-for-Linux are incredibly smart, talented, and
passionate developers who have their eyes set on a goal and are tirelessly
working towards it &amp;ndash; and, as time has shown, with a great deal of patience.
Though I&amp;rsquo;ve developed a mostly-well-earned reputation for being a fierce critic
of Rust, I do believe it has its place and I have a lot of respect for the work
these folks are doing. These developers are ambitious and motivated to make an
impact, and Linux is undoubtedly the highest-impact software in the world, and
in theory Linux is enthusiastically ready to accept motivated innovators into
its fold to facilitate that impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least in theory. In practice, the Linux community is the wild wild west, and
sweeping changes are infamously difficult to achieve consensus on, and this is
by far the broadest sweeping change ever proposed for the project. Every
subsystem is a private fiefdom, subject to the whims of each one of Linux&amp;rsquo;s
1,700+ maintainers, almost all of whom have a dog in this race. It&amp;rsquo;s herding
cats: introducing Rust effectively is one part coding work and ninety-nine parts
political work &amp;ndash; and it&amp;rsquo;s a lot of coding work. Every subsystem has its own
unique culture and its own strongly held beliefs and values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequences of these factors is that Rust-for-Linux has become a burnout
machine. My heart goes out to the developers who have been burned in this
project. It&amp;rsquo;s not fair. Free software is about putting in the work, it&amp;rsquo;s a
classical do-ocracy&amp;hellip; until it isn&amp;rsquo;t, and people get hurt. In spite of my
critiques of the project, I recognize the talent and humanity of everyone
involved, and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have wished these outcomes on them. I also have sympathy
for many of the established Linux developers who didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly want this on
their plate&amp;hellip; but that&amp;rsquo;s neither here nor there for the purpose of this post,
and any of those developers and their fiefdoms who went out of their way to make
life &lt;em&gt;difficult&lt;/em&gt; for the Rust developers above and beyond what was needed to
ensure technical excellence are accountable for these shitty outcomes.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where do we go now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, let me begin by re-iterating something from my last article on the
subject: &amp;ldquo;I wish [Rust-for-Linux] the best of luck and hope to see them
succeed&amp;rdquo;. Their path is theirs to choose, and though I might advise a moment to
rest before diving headfirst into this political maelstrom once again, I support
you in your endeavours if this is what you choose to do. Not my business. That
said, allow me to humbly propose a different path for your consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the pitch: a motivated group of talented Rust OS developers could build a
Linux-compatible kernel, from scratch, very quickly, with no need to engage in
LKML politics. You would be astonished by how quickly you can make meaningful
gains in this kind of environment; I think if the amount of effort being put
into Rust-for-Linux were applied to a new Linux-compatible OS we could have
something production ready for some use-cases within a few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel OS design is hard: projects like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.redox-os.org/&#34;&gt;Redox&lt;/a&gt; are working on this, but it
will take along time to bear fruit and research operating systems often have to
go back to the drawing board and make major revisions over and over again before
something useful and robust emerges. This is important work &amp;ndash; and near to my
heart &amp;ndash; but it&amp;rsquo;s not for everyone. However, making an OS which is based on a
proven design like Linux is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; easier and can be done very quickly. I worked
on my own novel OS design for a couple of years and it&amp;rsquo;s still stuck in design
hell and badly in need of being rethought; on the other hand I wrote a passable
Unix clone alone in less than 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust is a great fit for a large monolithic kernel design like Linux. Imagine
having the opportunity to implement something like the dcache from scratch in
Rust, without engaging with the politics &amp;ndash; that&amp;rsquo;s something a small group of
people, perhaps as few as one, could make substantial inroads on in a short
period of time taking full advantage of what Rust has on offer. Working towards
compatibility with an existing design can leverage a much larger talent pool
than the very difficult problem of novel OS design, a lot of people can manage
with a copy of the ISA manual and a missive to implement a single syscall in a
Linux-compatible fashion over the weekend. A small and motivated group of
contributors could take on the work of, say, building out io_uring compatibility
and start finding wins fast &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s a lot easier than designing io_uring from
scratch. I might even jump in and build out a driver or two for fun myself, that
sounds like a good opportunity for me to learn Rust properly with a fun project
with a well-defined scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attracting labor shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too difficult with this project in mind, either.
If there was &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; Rust OS project, with a well-defined scope and design (i.e.
aiming for Linux ABI compatibility), I&amp;rsquo;m sure there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of people who&amp;rsquo;d jump
in to stake a claim on some piece of the puzzle and put it together, and the
folks working on Rust-for-Linux have the benefit of a great deal of experience
with the Linux kernel to apply to oversight on the broader design approach.
Having a clear, well-proven goal in mind can also help to attract the same
people who want to make an impact in a way that a speculative research project
might not. Freeing yourselves of the LKML political battles would probably be a
big win for the ambitions of bringing Rust into kernel space. Such an effort
would also be a great way to mentor a new generation of kernel hackers who are
comfortable with Rust in kernel space and ready to deploy their skillset to the
research projects that will build a next-generation OS like Redox. The labor
pool of serious OS developers badly needs a project like this to make that
happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my suggestion for the Rust-for-Linux project is: you&amp;rsquo;re burned out and that&amp;rsquo;s
awful, I feel for you. It might be fun and rewarding to spend your recovery
busting out a small prototype Unix kernel and start fleshing out bits and pieces
of the Linux ABI with your friends. I can tell you from my own experience doing
something very much like this that it was a very rewarding burnout recovery
project for me. And who knows where it could go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again wishing you the best and hoping for your success, wherever the path
ahead leads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What about drivers?&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To pre-empt a response I expect to this article: there&amp;rsquo;s the annoying question
of driver support, of course. This was an annoying line of argumentation back
when Linux had poor driver support as well, and it will be a nuisance for a
hypothetical Linux-compatible Rust kernel as well. Well, the same frustrated
arguments I trotted out then are still ready at hand: you choose your
use-cases carefully. General-purpose comes later. Building an OS which
supports virtual machines, or a datacenter deployment, or a specific mobile
device whose vendor is volunteering labor for drivers, and so on, will come
first. You choose the hardware that supports the software, not the other way
around, or build the drivers you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, a decent spread of drivers should be pretty easy to implement with
the talent base you have at your disposal, so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t worry about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I saw that video, and yes, I expect much better from you in the
future, Ted. That was some hostile, toxic bullshit.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are living through an interesting moment in source-available software.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
The open source movement has always had, and continues to have, a solid
grounding in grassroots programmers building tools for themselves and forming
communities around them. Some looming giants brought on large sums of money &amp;ndash;
Linux, Mozilla, Apache, and so on &amp;ndash; and other giants made do without, like GNU,
but for the most part if anyone thought about open source 15 years ago they were
mostly thinking about grassroots communities who built software together for
fun. With the rise of GitHub and in particular the explosion of web development
as an open platform, commercial stakeholders in software caught on to the
compelling economics of open source. The open source boom that followed caused
open source software to have an enormous impact on everyone working in the
software industry, and, in one way or another, on everyone living on planet
Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade or so, a lot of businesses, particularly startups, saw
these economics unfolding in front of them and wanted to get in on this boom. A
lot of talented developers started working on open source software with an
explicit aim towards capitalizing on it, founding businesses and securing
capital investments to build their product &amp;ndash; an open source product. A few
years following the onset of these startups, the catch started to become
apparent. While open source was proven to be incredibly profitable and
profoundly useful for the software industry &lt;em&gt;as a whole&lt;/em&gt;, the economics of
making open source work for &lt;em&gt;one business&lt;/em&gt; are much different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes down to the fact that the free and open source software movements are
built on collaboration, and all of our success is attributable to this
foundation. The economics that drew commercial interest into the movement work
specifically because of this collaboration &amp;ndash; because the FOSS model allows
businesses to share R&amp;amp;D costs and bring together talent across corporate borders
into a great melting pot of innovation. And, yes, there is no small amount of
exploitation going on as well; businesses are pleased to take advantage of the
work of Jane Doe in Ohio&amp;rsquo;s FOSS project to make themselves money without sharing
any of it back. Nevertheless, the revolutionary economics of FOSS are &lt;em&gt;based on&lt;/em&gt;
collaboration, and are &lt;em&gt;incompatible with&lt;/em&gt; competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple truth of open source is that if you design your business model with
an eye towards competition, in which you are the only entity who can exclusively
monetize the software product, you must eschew the collaborative aspects of open
source &amp;ndash; and thus its greatest strength. Collaboration in open source works
because the collaborators, all representatives of different institutions, are
incentivized to work together for mutual profit. No one is incentivized to work
for you, for free, for your own exclusive profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than a few of these open source startups were understandably put out when
this reality started to set in. It turns out the market capitalization of a
business that has an open source product was often smaller than the investments
they had brought in. Under these conditions it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to give the investors
the one and only thing they demand &amp;ndash; a return on investment. The unbounded
growth demanded by the tech boom is even less likely to be attainable in open
source. There are, to be entirely clear, many business models which are
compatible with open source. But there are also many which are not. There are
many open source projects which can support a thriving business or even a
thriving sub-industry, but there are some ideas which, when placed in an open
source framing, simply cannot be capitalized on as effectively, or often at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open source ate a lot of lunches. There are some kinds of software which you
just can&amp;rsquo;t make in a classic silicon valley startup fashion anymore. Say you
want to write a database server &amp;ndash; a sector which has suffered a number of
rug-pulls from startups previously committed to open source. If you make it
closed source, you can&amp;rsquo;t easily sell it like you could 10 or 20 years ago, ala
MSSQL. This probably won&amp;rsquo;t work. If you make it open source, no one will pay you
for it and you&amp;rsquo;ll end up moaning about how the major cloud providers are
&amp;ldquo;stealing&amp;rdquo; your work. The best way to fund the development of something like
that is with a coalition of commercial stakeholders co-sponsoring or
co-maintaining the project in their respective self-interests, which is how
projects like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.postgresql.org/about/contributing/&#34;&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mesa.freedesktop.org/developers/&#34;&gt;Mesa&lt;/a&gt;, or the Linux kernel attract
substantial paid development resources. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really work as a startup
anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with these facts, there have been some challenges to the free and open
source model coming up in the past few years, some of which are getting
organized and starting to make serious moves. Bruce Perens, one of the founding
figures of the Open Source Initiative, is working on the &amp;ldquo;post-open&amp;rdquo; project;
&amp;ldquo;Fair Source&amp;rdquo; is another up-and-coming-effort, and there have been and will be
others besides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What these efforts generally have in common is a desire to change the commercial
dynamic of source-available software. In other words, the movers and shakers in
these movements want to get paid more, or more charitably, want to start a
movement in which programmers that work on source-available software as a
broader class get paid more. The other trait they have in common is a view that
the open source definition and the four freedoms of free software do not
sufficiently provide for this goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my part, I don&amp;rsquo;t think that this will work. I think that the aim of sole or
limited rights to monetization and the desire to foster a collaborative
environment are irreconcilable. These movements want to have both, and I simply
don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This logic is rooted in a deeper notion of ownership over the software, which is
both subtle and very important. This is a kind of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auteur&#34;&gt;auteur&lt;/a&gt; theory of software.
The notion is that the software they build &lt;em&gt;belongs&lt;/em&gt; to them. They possess a
sense of ownership over the software, which comes with a set of moral and
perhaps legal rights to the software, which, importantly, are withheld from any
entity other than themselves. The &amp;ldquo;developers&amp;rdquo; enjoy this special relationship
with the project &amp;ndash; the &amp;ldquo;developers&amp;rdquo; being the special class of person entitled
to this sense of ownership and the class to whom the up-and-coming
source-available movements make an appeal, in the sense of &amp;ldquo;pay the developers&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ndash; and third-party entities who work on the source code are merely
&amp;ldquo;contributors&amp;rdquo;, though they apply the same skills and labor to the project as
the &amp;ldquo;developers&amp;rdquo; do. The very distinction between &amp;ldquo;first-party&amp;rdquo; and
&amp;ldquo;third-party&amp;rdquo; developers is contingent on this &amp;ldquo;auteur&amp;rdquo; worldview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is quite different from how most open source projects have found their
wins. If Linux can be said to belong to anyone, it belongs to everyone. It is
for this reason that it is in everyone&amp;rsquo;s interests to collaborate on the
project. If it belonged to someone or some entity alone, especially if that
sense of ownership is rooted in justifying that entity&amp;rsquo;s sole right to
effectively capitalize on the software, the dynamic breaks down and the
incentive for the &amp;ldquo;third-party&amp;rdquo; class to participate is gone. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, clearly the proponents of these new source-available movements feel
otherwise. And, to be clear, I wish them well. I respect the right for authors
of software to distribute it under whatever terms they wish.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; And, for
my part, I do believe that source-available is a clear improvement over
proprietary software, even though these models fall short of what I perceive as
the advantages of open source. However, for these movements to have a shot at
success, they need to deeply understand these dynamics and the philosophical and
practical underpinnings of the free and open source movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is very important to me that we do not muddy the landscape of open
source by trying to reform, redefine, or expand our understanding of open source
to include movements which contradict this philosophy. My well-wishes are
contingent on any movements which aim to compete with open source stopping short
of &lt;em&gt;calling themselves&lt;/em&gt; open source. This is something I appreciate about the
fair source and post-open movements &amp;ndash; both movements explicitly disavow the
label of open source. If you want to build something new, be clear that it is
something new &amp;ndash; this is the ground rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you want to compete with open source, or even replace it with something new.
Again, I wish you good luck. But this question will be at the heart of your
challenge: will you be able to assume the mantle of the auteur and capitalize on
this software while still retaining the advantages that made open source
successful? Will you be able to appeal to the public in the same way open source
does while holding onto these commercial advantages for yourself? Finding a way
to answer this question with a &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; is the task laid before you. It will be
difficult; in the end, you will have to give something to the public to get
something in return. Simply saying that the software itself is a gift equal to
the labor you ask of the public is probably not going to work, especially when
this &amp;ldquo;gift&amp;rdquo; comes with monetary strings attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, I still believe in open source, and even in the commercial potential
of open source. It requires creativity and a clever business acumen to identify
and exploit market opportunities within this collaborative framework. To win in
open source you must embrace this collaboration and embrace the fact that you
will share the commercial market for the software with other entities. If you&amp;rsquo;re
up to that challenge, then let&amp;rsquo;s keep beating the open source drum together. If
not, these new movements may be a home for you &amp;ndash; but know that a lot of hard
work still lies ahead of you in that path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source-available is a general purpose term which describes any software
for which the source code is available to view in some respect. It applies
to all free and open source software, as well as to some kinds of software
which don&amp;rsquo;t meet either definition.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though I do not indulge in the fantasy that &amp;ldquo;third-party&amp;rdquo; developers
exist and are any less entitled to the rights of authorship as anyone else.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Writing a Unix clone in about a month</title>
      <link>https://drewdevault.com/2024/05/24/2024-05-24-Bunnix.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://drewdevault.com/2024/05/24/2024-05-24-Bunnix.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I needed a bit of a break from &amp;ldquo;real work&amp;rdquo; recently, so I started a new
programming project that was low-stakes and purely recreational. On April 21st,
I set out to see how much of a Unix-like operating system for x86_64 targets
that I could put together in about a month. The result is
&lt;a href=&#34;https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/bunnix&#34;&gt;Bunnix&lt;/a&gt;. Not including days I didn&amp;rsquo;t work
on Bunnix for one reason or another, I spent 27 days on this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a little demo of the results&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe title=&#34;A short demo of the Bunnix operating system&#34; width=&#34;720&#34; height=&#34;400&#34; src=&#34;https://spacepub.space/videos/embed/415822ac-5755-42a4-9081-b48639eed6be&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; sandbox=&#34;allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can try it for yourself if you like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cyanide.ayaya.dev/bunnix.iso&#34;&gt;Bunnix 0.0.0 iso&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To boot this ISO with qemu:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom bunnix.iso -display sdl -serial stdio
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also write the iso to a USB stick and boot it on real hardware. It will
probably work on most AMD64 machines &amp;ndash; I have tested it on a ThinkPad X220 and
a Starlabs Starbook Mk IV. Legacy boot and EFI are both supported. There are
some limitations to keep in mind, in particular that there is no USB support, so
a PS/2 keyboard (or PS/2 emulation via the BIOS) is required. Most laptops rig
up the keyboard via PS/2, and &lt;abbr title=&#34;your milage may vary&#34;&gt;YMMV&lt;/abbr&gt;
with USB keyboards via PS/2 emulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tip: the DOOM keybindings are weird. WASD to move, right shift to shoot, and
space to open doors. Exiting the game doesn&amp;rsquo;t work so just reboot when you&amp;rsquo;re
done playing. I confess I didn&amp;rsquo;t spend much time on that port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-there&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s there?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bunnix kernel is (mostly) written in &lt;a href=&#34;https://harelang.org&#34;&gt;Hare&lt;/a&gt;, plus some
C components, namely lwext4 for ext4 filesystem support and libvterm for the
kernel video terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kernel supports the following drivers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PCI (legacy)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AHCI block devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GPT and MBR partition tables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PS/2 keyboards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Platform serial ports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CMOS clocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Framebuffers (configured by the bootloaders)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ext4 and memfs filesystems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are numerous supported kernel features as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A virtual filesystem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A /dev populated with block devices, null, zero, and full psuedo-devices,
/dev/kbd and /dev/fb0, serial and video TTYs, and the /dev/tty controlling
terminal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reasonably complete terminal emulator and somewhat passable termios support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some 40 syscalls, including for example clock_gettime, poll, openat et al,
fork, exec, pipe, dup, dup2, ioctl, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bunnix is a single-user system and does not currently attempt to enforce Unix
file modes and ownership, though it could be made multi-user relatively easily
with a few more days of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Included are two bootloaders, one for legacy boot which is multiboot-compatible
and written in Hare, and another for EFI which is written in C. Both of them
load the kernel as an ELF file plus an initramfs, if required. The EFI
bootloader includes zlib to decompress the initramfs; multiboot-compatible
bootloaders handle this decompression for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The userspace is largely assembled from third-party sources. The following
third-party software is included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colossal Cave Adventure (advent)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dash (/bin/sh)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gzip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;less (pager)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lok (/bin/awk)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lolcat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mandoc (man pages)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sbase (core utils)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tcc (C compiler)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vim 5.7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The libc is derived from musl libc and contains numerous modifications to suit
Bunnix&amp;rsquo;s needs. The curses library is based on netbsd-curses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system works but it&amp;rsquo;s pretty buggy and some parts of it are quite slapdash:
your milage will vary. Be prepared for it to crash!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-bunnix-came-together&#34;&gt;How Bunnix came together&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started documenting the process on Mastodon on day 3 &amp;ndash; check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://fosstodon.org/@drewdevault/112319697309218275&#34;&gt;the
Mastodon thread&lt;/a&gt; for the
full story. Here&amp;rsquo;s what it looked like on day 3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.fosstodon.org/media_attachments/files/112/319/693/110/194/041/original/2c0bd7006a74aece.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of an early Bunnix build, which boots up, sets up available memory, and exercises an early in-memory filesystem&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s some thoughts after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of Bunnix&amp;rsquo;s code stems from an earlier project,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/helios&#34;&gt;Helios&lt;/a&gt;. This includes portions of the kernel
which are responsible for some relatively generic CPU setup (GDT, IDT, etc), and
some drivers like AHCI were adapted for the Bunnix system. I admit that it would
probably not have been possible to build Bunnix so quickly without prior
experience through Helios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the more challenging aspects were ext4 support and the virtual terminal,
for which I brought in two external dependencies, lwext4 and libvterm. Both
proved to be challenging integrations. I had to rewrite my filesystem layer a
few times, and it&amp;rsquo;s still buggy today, but getting a proper Unix filesystem
design (including openat and good handling of inodes) requires digging into
lwext4 internals a bit more than I&amp;rsquo;d have liked. I also learned a lot about
mixing source languages into a Hare project, since the kernel links together
Hare, assembly, and C sources &amp;ndash; it works remarkably well but there are some
pain points I noticed, particularly with respect to building the ABI integration
riggings. It&amp;rsquo;d be nice to automate conversion of C headers into Hare forward
declaration modules. Some of this work already exists in hare-c, but has a ways
to go. If I were to start again, I would probably be more careful in my design
of the filesystem layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting the terminal right was difficult as well. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure that I was going
to add one at all, but I eventually decided that I wanted to port vim and that
was that. libvterm is a great terminal state machine library, but it&amp;rsquo;s poorly
documented and required a lot of fine-tuning to integrate just right. I also
ended up spending a lot of time on performance to make sure that the terminal
worked smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another difficult part to get right was the scheduler. Helios has a simpler
scheduler than Bunnix, and while I initially based the Bunnix scheduler on
Helios I had to throw out and rewrite quite a lot of it. Both Helios and Bunnix
are single-CPU systems, but unlike Helios, Bunnix allows context switching
within the kernel &amp;ndash; in fact, even preemptive task switching enters and exits
via the kernel. This necessitates multiple kernel stacks and a different
approach to task switching. However, the advantages are numerous, one of which
being that implementing blocking operations like disk reads and pipe(2) are much
simpler with wait queues. With a robust enough scheduler, the rest of the kernel
and its drivers come together pretty easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another source of frustration was signals, of course. Helios does not attempt to
be a Unix and gets away without these, but to build a Unix, I needed to
implement signals, big messy hack though they may be. The signal implementation
which ended up in Bunnix is pretty bare-bones: I mostly made sure that SIGCHLD
worked correctly so that I could port dash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porting third-party software was relatively easy thanks to basing my libc on
musl libc. I imported large swaths of musl into my own libc and adapted it to
run on Bunnix, which gave me a pretty comprehensive and reliable C library
pretty fast. With this in place, porting third-party software was a breeze, and
most of the software that&amp;rsquo;s included was built with minimal patching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-learned&#34;&gt;What I learned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bunnix was an interesting project to work on. My other project, Helios, is a
microkernel design that&amp;rsquo;s Not Unix, while Bunnix is a monolithic kernel that is
much, much closer to Unix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I was surprised to learn a lot about is filesystems. Helios, as a
microkernel, spreads the filesystem implementation across many drivers running
in many separate processes. This works well enough, but one thing I discovered
is that it&amp;rsquo;s quite important to have caching in the filesystem layer, even if
only to track living objects. When I revisit Helios, I will have a lot of work
to do refactoring (or even rewriting) the filesystem code to this end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach to drivers is also, naturally, much simpler in a monolithic kernel
design, though I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely pleased with all of the stuff I heaped into ring
0. There might be room for an improved Helios scheduler design that incorporates
some of the desirable control flow elements from the monolithic design into a
microkernel system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also finally learned how signals work from top to bottom, and boy is it ugly.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always felt that this was one of the weakest points in the design of Unix
and this project did nothing to disabuse me of that notion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had also tried to avoid using a bitmap allocator in Helios, and generally
memory management in Helios is a bit fussy altogether &amp;ndash; one of the biggest pain
points with the system right now. However, Bunnix uses a simple bitmap allocator
for all conventional pages on the system and I found that it works really,
really well and does not have nearly as much overhead as I had feared it would.
I will almost certainly take those lessons back to Helios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I&amp;rsquo;m quite sure that putting together Bunnix in just 30 days is a feat
which would not have been possible with a microkernel design. At the end of the
day, monolithic kernels are just much simpler to implement. The advantages of a
microkernel design are compelling, however &amp;ndash; perhaps a better answer lies in a
hybrid kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-next&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bunnix was (note the past tense) a project that I wrote for the purpose of
recreational programming, so it&amp;rsquo;s purpose is to be fun to work on. And I&amp;rsquo;ve had
my fun! At this point I don&amp;rsquo;t feel the need to invest more time and energy into
it, though it would definitely benefit from some. In the future I may spend a
few days on it here and there, and I would be happy to integrate improvements
from the community &amp;ndash; send patches to my &lt;a href=&#34;https://lists.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/public-inbox&#34;&gt;public inbox&lt;/a&gt;. But for the most
part it is an art project which is now more-or-less complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next steps in OS development will be a return to Helios with a lot of lessons
learned and some major redesigns in the pipeline. But I still think that Bunnix
is a fun and interesting OS in its own right, in no small part due to its
demonstration of Hare as a great language for kernel hacking. Some of the
priorities for improvements include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A directory cache for the filesystem and better caching generally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ironing out ext4 bugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;procfs and top&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mmaping files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More signals (e.g. SIGSEGV)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multi-user support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NVMe block devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IDE block devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ATAPI and ISO 9660 support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intel HD audio support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network stack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hare toolchain in the base system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self hosting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Copyleft licenses are not “restrictive”</title>
      <link>https://drewdevault.com/2024/04/19/2024-04-19-Copyleft-is-not-restrictive.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://drewdevault.com/2024/04/19/2024-04-19-Copyleft-is-not-restrictive.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One may observe an axis, or a &amp;ldquo;spectrum&amp;rdquo;, along which free and open source
software licenses can be organized, where one end is &amp;ldquo;permissive&amp;rdquo; and the other
end is &amp;ldquo;copyleft&amp;rdquo;. It is important to acknowledge, however, that though copyleft
can be found at the opposite end of an axis with respect to permissive, it is
not synonymous with the linguistic antonym of permissive &amp;ndash; that is, copyleft
licenses are not &amp;ldquo;restrictive&amp;rdquo; by comparison with permissive licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aside: Free software is not synonymous with copyleft and open source is not
synonymous with permissive, though this is a common misconception. Permissive
licenses are generally free software and copyleft licenses are generally open
source; the distinction between permissive and copyleft is orthogonal to the
distinction between free software and open source.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a common misunderstanding to construe copyleft licenses as more
&amp;ldquo;restrictive&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;less free&amp;rdquo; than permissive licenses. This view is predicated
on a shallow understanding of freedom, a sort of passive freedom that presents
as the absence of obligations. Copyleft is predicated on a deeper understanding
of freedom in which freedom is a &lt;em&gt;positive guarantee of rights&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a
href=&#34;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberty-positive-negative/&#34;&gt;[source]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s consider the matter of freedom, obligation, rights, and restrictions in
depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both forms of licenses include obligations, which are not the same thing as
restrictions. An example of an obligation can be found in the permissive MIT
license:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Permission is hereby granted […] to deal in the Software without restriction
[…] subject to the following conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all
copies or substantial portions of the Software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This obliges the user, when distributing copies of the software, to include the
copyright notice. However, it does not &lt;em&gt;restrict&lt;/em&gt; the use of the software under
any conditions. An example of a restriction comes from the infamous JSON
license, which adds the following clause to a stock MIT license:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM famously petitioned Douglas Crockford for, and received, a license to do
evil with JSON.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This kind of clause is broadly referred to in the free
software jargon as &amp;ldquo;discrimination against field of endeavour&amp;rdquo;, and such
restrictions contravene both the free software and open source definitions. To
quote the &lt;a href=&#34;https://opensource.org/osd&#34;&gt;Open Source Definition&lt;/a&gt;, clause 6:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a
specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the program from
being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No such restrictions are found in free or open source software licenses, be they
permissive or copyleft &amp;ndash; all FOSS licenses permit the use of the software for
any purpose without restriction. You can sell both permissive and copyleft
software, use it as part of a commercial cloud service,&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; use the software
as part of a nuclear weapons program,&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or do whatever else you want with
it. There are no restrictions on how free software is used, regardless of if it
is permissive or copyleft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copyleft does not impose restrictions, but it does impose obligations. The
obligations exist to guarantee rights to the users of the software &amp;ndash; in other
words, to ensure freedoms. In this respect copyleft licenses are &lt;em&gt;more free&lt;/em&gt;
than permissive licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freedom is a political concept, and in order to understand this, we must
consider it in political terms, which is to say as an exercise in power
dynamics. Freedom without obligation is a contradiction. Freedom &lt;em&gt;emerges&lt;/em&gt; from
obligations, specifically obligations imposed on power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where does freedom come from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the United States as an example, a society which sets forth freedom as
a core political value.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Freedoms in the US are ultimately grounded in the US
constitution and its bill of rights. These tools create freedoms by guaranteeing
rights to US citizens through the imposition of &lt;em&gt;obligations&lt;/em&gt; on the government.
For instance, you have a right to an attorney when accused of a crime in the
United States, and as such the government is &lt;em&gt;obliged&lt;/em&gt; to provide you with one.
It is from obligations such as these that freedom emerges. Freedom of assembly,
another example, is guaranteed such that the police are prevented from breaking
up peaceful protests &amp;ndash; this freedom emerges from a &lt;em&gt;constraint&lt;/em&gt; (or
restriction, if you must) on power (the government) as a means of guaranteeing
the rights and freedom of those with less power by comparison (its citizens).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who holds the power in the context of software?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider non-free software by contrast: software is written by corporations and
sold on to users with substantial restrictions on its use. Corporations hold
more power than individuals: they have more resources (e.g. money), more
influence, and, in a sense more fundamental to the software itself, they retain
in private the tools to understand the software, or to modify its behavior, and
they dictate the conditions under which it may be used (e.g. only if your
license key has not expired, or only for certain purposes). This is true of
anyone who retains the source code in private and uses copyright law to enforce
their will upon the software &amp;ndash; in this way they possess, and exercise, power
over the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Permissive licenses do not provide any checks on this power; generally they
preserve &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_rights&#34;&gt;moral rights&lt;/a&gt; and little
else. Permissive licenses provide for relatively few and narrow freedoms, and
are not particularly &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; as such. Copyleft licenses constrain these powers
through additional obligations, and from these obligations greater freedoms
emerge. Specifically, they oblige reciprocity. They are distinguished from
permissive licenses in this manner, but where permissive licenses &lt;em&gt;permit&lt;/em&gt;,
copyleft does not &lt;em&gt;restrict&lt;/em&gt; per-se &amp;ndash; better terms might be &amp;ldquo;reciprocal&amp;rdquo; and
&amp;ldquo;non-reciprocal&amp;rdquo;, but perhaps that ship has sailed. &amp;ldquo;You may use this software
&lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; is a statement made both by permissive and copyleft licenses, with
different &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt;s. Neither form of license says &amp;ldquo;you cannot use this software &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt;
&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;; licenses which do so are non-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Permissive licenses and copyleft licenses are both free software, but only the
latter provides a guarantee of rights, and while both might be free only the
latter provides &lt;em&gt;freedom&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strictly speaking this exception was for JSLint, not JSON. But I digress.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is even true if the software uses the AGPL license.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment here to entertain the supposition that nuclear warheads
are legally obliged to include a copy of the MIT license, if they
incorporate MIT licensed code in their guidance systems, on board, as they
are &amp;ldquo;distributing&amp;rdquo; that software to the, err, recipients. As it were.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extent to which it achieves this has, of course, been the subject of
intense debate for centuries.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>FDO&#39;s conduct enforcement actions regarding Vaxry</title>
      <link>https://drewdevault.com/2024/04/09/2024-04-09-FDO-conduct-enforcement.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://drewdevault.com/2024/04/09/2024-04-09-FDO-conduct-enforcement.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;freedesktop(.org), aka FDO, recently banned Hyprland maintainer Vaxry from the
FDO community, and in response Vaxry has taken his case to the court of public
opinion, publishing their email exchanges and writing about it on his blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It saddens me to bear witness to these events today. I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://drewdevault.com/2023/09/17/Hyprland-toxicity.html&#34;&gt;in September of
last year&lt;/a&gt; about problems with toxicity in the Hyprland community. I
initially reached out to Vaxry to discuss these problems in private in February
of last year. I failed to get through to him, leading to that blog post in
September. I spent some time in the following weeks talking with Vaxry on his
behavior and his community&amp;rsquo;s social norms, again in private, but again, I was
unable to get through to him. Unfortunately, we find ourselves again leaving the
private sphere and discussing Vaxry&amp;rsquo;s behavior and the problem posed by the
Hyprland community once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact of the matter is that Hyprland remains a toxic community, enabled and
encouraged by its toxic leadership, namely Vaxry. FDO&amp;rsquo;s decision to ban Vaxry is
ultimately a consequence of Vaxry&amp;rsquo;s behavior, and because he has elected to
appeal his case in public, I am compelled to address his behavior in public. I
hereby rise firmly in defense of FDO&amp;rsquo;s decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I invite you to start by reading the two email threads, &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.vaxry.net/resource/articleFDO/LyudeMails.pdf&#34;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.vaxry.net/resource/articleFDO/lyudeReply.pdf&#34;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;,
which Vaxry has published for your consideration, as well as Vaxry&amp;rsquo;s follow-ups
on his blog, &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.vaxry.net/articles/2024-fdo-and-redhat&#34;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.vaxry.net/articles/2024-fdo-and-redhat2&#34;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my read on the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDO officer that reached out to Vaxry did it after Vaxry&amp;rsquo;s problematic
behavior was brought to her attention by members of the FDO community, and was
acting on her mandate within the FDO conduct enforcement board by investigating
complaints submitted to her by this community. It is not a stretch to suggest a
close relationship between these communities exists: FDO is the steward of both
the Wayland protocol and implementation and the wlroots library, essential
dependencies of Hyprland and sources for collaboration between Hyprland and FDO.
Vaxry and other members of the Hyprland community had already participated
extensively in these projects (mainly in discussions on IRC and GitLab issues)
at the time of the email exchange, in spaces where the code of conduct applies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDO officer duly investigated the complaints she had received and found, in
collaboration with the other members of the FDO conduct enforcement team, that
they were credible, and worrying. There are numerous examples of behavior from
Vaxry that contravenes the FDO code of conduct in several different respects,
and any number of them would be grounds for an immediate ban. Since these
behaviors are concerning, but did not take place in the FDO community, the
conduct board decided to issue a warning in private, stating that if this sort
of behavior was seen in the FDO community that it would result in enforcement
action from the conduct team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the actions from the FDO conduct team are reasonable and show
considerable restraint. Vaxry could have taken it in stride with no consequences
to himself. Instead, he immediately escalated the situation. He construes the
FDO officer&amp;rsquo;s polite and well-reasoned warning as threats and intimidation. He
minimizes examples of his own hate speech by shrugging them off as a joke. He
belittles the FDO officer and builds a straw man wherein her email is an
official statement on behalf of RedHat, and cites a conspiracy theory about
&lt;abbr title=&#34;diversity, equity, and inclusion&#34;&gt;DEI&lt;/abbr&gt; programs at RedHat as
justification for calling the FDO officer a hypocrite. He is insulted on my
behalf that my name was cited in the FDO officer&amp;rsquo;s email in lowercase, &amp;ldquo;drew&amp;rdquo;,
and feels the need to address this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDO officer responds to Vaxry&amp;rsquo;s unhinged rant with a sarcastic quip
clarifying that it was indeed within the FDO conduct team&amp;rsquo;s remit to ban Vaxry
from their GitLab instance &amp;ndash; I confess that in my view this was somewhat
unprofessional, though I can easily sympathize with the FDO officer given the
context. Following this, Vaxry states that Hyprland will cease all communication
with FDO&amp;rsquo;s conduct team and &lt;em&gt;ignore&lt;/em&gt; (emphasis his) any future emails from them.
Finally, he threatens legal action (on what basis is unclear) and signs the
email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how you feel about the conduct team issuing a private warning to
Vaxry on the basis of activities outside of FDO community spaces, the email
thread that ensues most certainly is within the scope of the FDO code of
conduct, and Vaxry&amp;rsquo;s behavior therein is sufficient justification for a ban from
the FDO community as far as I&amp;rsquo;m concerned. The conduct team cites Vaxry&amp;rsquo;s stated
intention to ignore any future conduct interventions as the ultimate reason for
the ban, which I find entirely reasonable on FDO&amp;rsquo;s part. I have banned people
for far less than this, and I stand by it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaxry&amp;rsquo;s follow-up blog posts only serve to underscore this point. First of all,
he immediately opens with a dog-whistle calling for the reader to harass the FDO
officer in question: &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t condone harassing this person, but here is their
full name, employer and contact details&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not condone any hateful messages sent towards any of the parties
mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I have received an email filled with threats to my inbox, from a
member of the X.org board, Freedesktop.org, and a Red Hat employee. Their name
is [redacted].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Vaxry claims to have apologised for his past conduct, which is not
true. In lieu of an apology, Vaxry has spent the &amp;ldquo;1.5 years&amp;rdquo; since the last
incident posting angry rants on his blog calling out minority representation and
&amp;ldquo;social justice warriors&amp;rdquo; in light of his perceived persecution. Meanwhile the
Hyprland community remains a toxic place, welcoming hate, bullying, and
harassment, but now prohibiting all &amp;ldquo;political&amp;rdquo; speech, which in practice means
any discussion of LGBTQ topics, though this is largely unenforced. In the end,
the Hyprland community&amp;rsquo;s fundamental problem is that they&amp;rsquo;re all &amp;ldquo;just having
fun&amp;rdquo;, and it seems that they can&amp;rsquo;t have &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; unless it&amp;rsquo;s at someone else&amp;rsquo;s
expense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDO team is right that Hyprland&amp;rsquo;s community reflects poorly on the Linux
desktop community as a whole. Vaxry has created a foothold for hate,
transphobia, homophobia, bullying, and harassment in the Linux desktop
community. We are right to take action to correct this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every option other than banning Vaxry has been exhausted over the past year and
a half. I personally spent several weeks following my last blog post on the
matter discussing Vaxry&amp;rsquo;s behavior in confidence and helping him understand how
to improve, and at my suggestion he joined a private community of positive male
role models to discuss these issues in a private and empathetic space. After a
few weeks of these private discussions, the last thing he said to me was &amp;ldquo;I do
believe there could be arguments to sway my opinion towards genocide&amp;rdquo;.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s nothing left to do but to build a fence around Hyprland and protect the
rest of the community from them. I know that there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of good people who
use and contribute to Hyprland, and I&amp;rsquo;m sorry for those of you who are affected
by this problem. But, in the end, actions have consequences. The rest of the
community has no choice but to sanction Vaxry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, to Vaxry &amp;ndash; I know you&amp;rsquo;re reading this &amp;ndash; there are going to continue to be
consequences for your actions, but it&amp;rsquo;s still not too late to change. I know
it&amp;rsquo;s humiliating to be called out like this, and I really would rather not have
had to do so. FDO is probably not the last time you&amp;rsquo;re going to be banned if you
don&amp;rsquo;t change course, and it would reflect better on you if you took it on the
chin and didn&amp;rsquo;t post inflammatory rants on your blog &amp;ndash; trust me, you don&amp;rsquo;t look
like the good guy here. You are trapped in an echo chamber of hate, anger, and
bigotry. I hope that you find a way out, and that someday you can build a
community which is as great as your software is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, to the FDO officer in question: I&amp;rsquo;m so sorry that you&amp;rsquo;re at the ass end of
all of this hate and abuse. You don&amp;rsquo;t deserve any of it. You did a good job, and
I&amp;rsquo;m proud of you and the rest of the FDO conduct team. If you need any support,
someone to talk to, don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to reach out and ask, on IRC, Matrix, email,
whatever. Don&amp;rsquo;t read the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on that note, I condemn in the harshest terms the response from communities
like /r/linux on the subject. The vile harassment and hate directed at the FDO
officer in question is obscene and completely unjustifiable. I don&amp;rsquo;t care what
window manager or desktop environment you use &amp;ndash; this kind of behavior is
completely uncalled for. I expect better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P.S. The Hyprland community has already descended on me before even publishing
this post, after I called Vaxry out on Mastodon a few hours ago. My
notifications are not full of reasonable objections to my complaints, but
instead the response is slurs and death threats. This only serves to prove my
characterization of the Hyprland community as deeply toxic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is taken out of context. But, if you raise this objection, I
struggle to imagine in what context you think this statement can be read
sympathetically.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Why Prusa is floundering, and how you can avoid their fate</title>
      <link>https://drewdevault.com/2023/12/26/2023-12-26-Prusa-is-floundering.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://drewdevault.com/2023/12/26/2023-12-26-Prusa-is-floundering.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prusa is a 3D printer manufacturer which has a long history of being admired by
the 3D printing community for high quality, open source printers. They have been
struggling as of late, and came under criticism for making the firmware of their
Mk4 printer non-free.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2023/12/25/life-and-death-of-open-source/&#34;&gt;Armin Ronacher&lt;/a&gt; uses Prusa as a case-study in why open source companies
fail, and uses this example to underline his argument that open source needs to
adapt for commercial needs, namely by adding commercial exclusivity clauses to
its licenses &amp;ndash; Armin is one of the principal proponents of the non-free
Functional Source License. Armin cites his experience with a Chinese
manufactured 3D printer as evidence that intellectual property is at the heart
of Prusa&amp;rsquo;s decline, and goes on to discuss how this dynamic applies to his own
work in developing a non-free license for use with Sentry. I find this work
pretty interesting &amp;ndash; FSL is a novel entry into the non-free license compendium,
and it&amp;rsquo;s certainly a better way to do software than proprietary models, assuming
that it&amp;rsquo;s not characterized as free or open source. But, allow me to use the
same case study to draw different conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is clear on the face of it that Prusa&amp;rsquo;s move to a non-free firmware is
unrelated to their struggles with the Chinese competition &amp;ndash; their firmware was
GPL&amp;rsquo;d, and the cited competitor (Bambu) evidently respects copyleft, and there&amp;rsquo;s
no evidence that Bambu&amp;rsquo;s printers incorporate derivatives of Prusa&amp;rsquo;s firmware in
a manner which violates the GPL. Making the license non-free is immaterial to
the market dynamics between Prusa and Bambu, so the real explanation must lie
elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you had asked me 10 years ago what I expected Prusa&amp;rsquo;s largest risk would be,
I would have simply answered &amp;ldquo;China&amp;rdquo; and you would have probably said the same.
The Chinese economy and industrial base can outcompete Western manufacturing in
almost every manufacturing market.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This was always the obvious
vulnerability in their business model, and they &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; needed to be
prepared for this situation, or their death was all but certain. Prusa made one
of the classic errors in open source business models: they made their product,
made it open source, sold it, and assumed that they were done working on their
business model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was inevitable that someday Chinese manufacturers would undercut Prusa on
manufacturing costs. Prusa responded to this certainty by not diversifying their
business model whatsoever. There has only ever been one Prusa product: their
latest 3D printer model. The Mk4 costs $1,200. You can buy the previous
generation (at $1,000), or the MINI (from 2019, $500). You can open your wallet
and get their high-end printers, which are neat but fail to address the one
thing that most users at this price-point really want, which is more build
volume. Or, you can buy an Ender 3 off Amazon right now for $180 and you&amp;rsquo;ll get
better than half of the value of an Mk4 at an 85% discount. You could also buy
Creality&amp;rsquo;s flagship model for a cool $800 and get a product which beats the Mk4
in every respect. China has joined the market, bringing with them all of the
competitive advantages their industrial base can bring to bear, and Prusa&amp;rsquo;s
naive strategy is causing their position to fall like a rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone new to 3D printing will pick up an Ender and will probably be happy with
it for 1-2 years. When they upgrade, will they upgrade to a Prusa or an Ender 5?
Three to five years a customer spends in someone else&amp;rsquo;s customer pipeline is an
incredibly expensive opportunity cost Prusa is missing out on. This opportunity
cost is the kind of arithmetic that would make loss leaders like a cheap,
low-end, low-or-negative-margin Prusa printer make financial sense. Hell, Prusa
should have made a separate product line of white-labeled Chinese entry-level 3D
printers just to get people on the Prusa brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prusa left many stones unturned. Bambu&amp;rsquo;s cloud slicer is a massive lost
opportunity for Prusa. On-demand cloud printing services are another lost
opportunity. Prusa could have built a marketplace for models &amp;amp; parts and skimmed
a margin off of the top, but they waited until 2022 to launch Printables &amp;ndash;
waiting until the 11th hour when everyone was fed up with Thingiverse. Imagine a
Prusa where it works out of the box, you can fire up a slicer in your browser
which auto-connects to your printer and prints models from a Prusa-operated
model repository, paying $10 for a premium model, $1 off the top goes to Prusa,
with the same saved payment details which ensure that a fresh spool of Prusa
filament arrives at your front door when it auto-detects that your printer is
almost out. The print you want is too big for your build volume? Click here to
have it cloud printed &amp;ndash; do you want priority shipping for that? Your hot-end is
reaching the end of its life &amp;ndash; as one of our valued business customers on our
premium support contract we would be happy to send you a temporary replacement
printer while yours is shipped in for service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prusa&amp;rsquo;s early foothold in the market was strong, and they were wise to execute
the way they did early on. But they &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; had to diversify their lines of
business. Prusa left gaping holes in the market and utterly failed to capitalize
on any of them. Prusa could have been synonymous with 3D printing if they had
invested in the brand (though they probably needed a better name). I should be
able to walk into a Best Buy and pick up an entry-level Prusa for $250-$500, or
into a Home Depot and pick up a workshop model for $1000-$2000. I should be able
to bring it home, unbox it, scan a QR code to register it with PrusaConnect, and
have a Benchy printing in less than 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese manufacturers did all of this and more, and they&amp;rsquo;re winning. They aren&amp;rsquo;t
just cheaper &amp;ndash; they offer an outright better product. These are not cheap
knock-offs: if you want the best 3D printer today it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a Chinese
one, regardless of how much you want to spend, but, as it happens, you&amp;rsquo;re going
to spend less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that none of this is material to the license of the product, be it free or
non-free. It&amp;rsquo;s about building a brand, developing a customer relationship, and
identifying and exploiting market opportunities. Hackers and enthusiasts who
found companies like Prusa tend to imagine that the product is everything, but
it&amp;rsquo;s not. Maybe 10% of the work is developing the 3D printer itself &amp;ndash;
don&amp;rsquo;t abandon the other 90% of your business. Especially when you make that 10%
open: someone else is going to repurpose it, do the other 90%, and eat your
lunch. FOSS is &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; precisely because it makes that 10% into community
property and shares the cost of innovation, but you&amp;rsquo;d be a fool to act as if
that was all there was to it. You need to deal with sales and marketing, chase
down promising leads, identify and respond to risks, look for and exploit new
market opportunities, and much more to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a classic failure mode of open source businesses, and it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Prusa&amp;rsquo;s
fault&lt;/em&gt;. They had an excellent foothold early in the market, leveraging open
source and open hardware to great results and working hand-in-hand with
enthusiasts early on to develop the essential technology of 3D printing. Then,
they figured they were done developing their business model, and completely
dropped the ball as a result. Open source is not an &amp;ldquo;if you build it, the money
will come&amp;rdquo; situation, and to think otherwise is a grave mistake. Businesses need
to identify their risks and then mitigate them, and if they don&amp;rsquo;t do that due
diligence, then it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;their fault&lt;/em&gt; when it fails &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s not a problem with
FOSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free and open source software is an incredibly powerful tool, including as a
commercial opportunity. FOSS really has changed the world! But building a
business is still hard, and in addition to its fantastic advantages, the FOSS
model poses important and challenging constraints that you need to understand
and work with. You have to be creative, and you must do a risk/reward assessment
to understand how it applies to your business and how you can utilize it for
commercial success. Do the legwork and you can utilize FOSS for a competitive
advantage, but skip this step and you will probably fail within a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sourced this information from Armin&amp;rsquo;s blog post, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t
hold up to a later fact check: the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware-Buddy&#34;&gt;Mk4 firmware&lt;/a&gt; seems to be
free software. It seems the controversy here has to do with Prusa
developing its slicer software behind closed doors and doing occasional
source-code dumps, rather than managing a more traditional &amp;ldquo;bazaar&amp;rdquo; style
project.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, there are still vulnerabilities in the Chinese industrial
base that can be exploited by savvy Western entrepreneurs. Chinese access to
Western markets is constrained below a certain scale, for instance, in ways
that Western businesses are not.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Richard Stallman&#39;s political discourse on sex</title>
      <link>https://drewdevault.com/2023/11/25/2023-11-26-RMS-on-sex.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 25 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://drewdevault.com/2023/11/25/2023-11-26-RMS-on-sex.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Richard Stallman, the founder of the Free Software Foundation, has been subject
to numerous allegations of misconduct. He stepped down in 2019, and following
his re-instatement in 2021, a famous &lt;a href=&#34;https://rms-open-letter.github.io/&#34;&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; was published in which
numerous organizations and individuals from throughout the Free Software
ecosystem called for his removal from the Free Software Foundation. The letter
had no effect; Stallman remains a voting member of the FSF&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fsf.org/about/staff-and-board&#34;&gt;board of
directors&lt;/a&gt; to this day and continues to receive numerous &lt;a href=&#34;https://stallman.org/talks.html&#34;&gt;speaking
engagements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Content warning: This article discusses sexual abuse, sexual assault, sexual
harassment, and all of the above with respect to minors, as well as the systemic
normalization of abuse, and directly quotes statements which participate in the
normalization of abuse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article presents an analysis of Stallman&amp;rsquo;s political discourse on sex with
the aim of establishing the patterns that cause the sort of discomfort that led
to Stallman&amp;rsquo;s public condemnation. In particular, we will address how Stallman
speaks about sexual assault, harassment, consent, and minors in his discourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that it is important to acknowledge this behavior not as a series of
isolated incidents, nor a conflict with Stallman&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fsf.org/news/statement-of-fsf-board-on-election-of-richard-stallman&#34;&gt;personal style&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;,
but a pattern of behavior from which a political narrative forms, and draws
attention to the fact that the meager retractions, excuses, and non-apologies
from both Stallman and the Free Software Foundation as a whole fail to account
for that pattern in a meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The failure of the Free Software community to account for Richard Stallman&amp;rsquo;s
behavior has a chilling effect. The norms set by our leadership influence the
norms of our broader community, and many members of the Free Software community
look to Stallman as a ideological and political leader. The norms Stallman
endorses are harmful and deeply confronting and alienating to many people, in
particular women and children. Should these norms be adopted by our movement, we
risk creating a community which enables the exploitation of vulnerable people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s begin to address this by considering Stallman&amp;rsquo;s retraction of his comments
in support of pedophilia. The following comment from Stallman in 2013 drew harsh
criticism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is little evidence to justify the widespread assumption that willing
participation in pedophilia hurts children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20210325014249/https://stallman.org/archives/2012-nov-feb.html#04_January_2013_(Pedophilia)&#34;&gt;stallman.org, 04 January 2013 &amp;ldquo;Pedophilia&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following much of the criticism directed at Stallman, he had a number of
&amp;ldquo;personal conversations&amp;rdquo; which reframed his views. Of the many comments Stallman
has made which drew ire, this is one of the few for which a correction was made,
in September 2019:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many years ago I posted that I could not see anything wrong about sex between
an adult and a child, if the child accepted it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through personal conversations in recent years, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to understand how
sex with a child can harm per psychologically. This changed my mind about the
matter: I think adults should not do that. I am grateful for the conversations
that enabled me to understand why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20210325015259/https://stallman.org/archives/2019-jul-oct.html#14_September_2019_(Sex_between_an_adult_and_a_child_is_wrong)&#34;&gt;stallman.org, 14 September 2019 &amp;ldquo;Sex between an adult and a child is wrong&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This statement from Stallman has been accepted by his defenders as evidence of
his capitulation on pedophilia. I argue that this statement is misleading due to
the particular way Stallman uses the word &amp;ldquo;child&amp;rdquo;. When Stallman uses this word,
he does so with a very specific meaning, which he explains on his website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children: Humans up to age 12 or 13 are children. After that, they become
adolescents or teenagers. Let&amp;rsquo;s resist the practice of infantilizing
teenagers, by not calling them &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stallman.org/antiglossary.html&#34;&gt;stallman.org, &amp;ldquo;Anti-glossary&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems clear from this definition is that Stallman&amp;rsquo;s comments are not a
capitulation at all. His 2019 retraction, when interpreted using his definition
of &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rdquo;, does not contradict most of Stallman&amp;rsquo;s past statements regarding
sex and minors, including his widely criticized defenses of many people accused
of sexual impropriety with minors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stallman&amp;rsquo;s most recent direct response to his criticism underscores this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was right for me to talk about the injustice to Minsky, but it was
tone-deaf that I didn&amp;rsquo;t acknowledge as context the injustice that Epstein did
to women or the pain that caused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fsf.org/news/rms-addresses-the-free-software-community&#34;&gt;fsf.org, April 12, 2021, &amp;ldquo;RMS addresses the free software community&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stallman qualifies his apology by explicitly re-affirming his defense of Marvin
Minsky, which is addressed in detail later in this piece. Stallman&amp;rsquo;s
doubling-down here is consistent with the supposition that Stallman maintains
the view that minors can have sexual relationships with adults of any age,
provided that they aren&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; in other words, provided they&amp;rsquo;re at
least 13 or 14 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stallman cares deeply about language and its usage. His strange and deliberate
usage of the word &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rdquo; is also found many times throughout his political
notes over the years. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds horrible: &amp;ldquo;UN peacekeepers accused of child rape in South Sudan.&amp;rdquo;
But the article makes it pretty clear that the &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rdquo; involved were not
children. They were teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20180509120046/https://stallman.org/archives/2018-mar-jun.html#30_April_2018_(UN_peacekeepers_in_South_Sudan)&#34;&gt;stallman.org, 30 April 2018 &amp;ldquo;UN peacekeepers in South Sudan&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here Stallman again explicitly distinguishes &amp;ldquo;teenagers&amp;rdquo; from children, drawing
this distinction especially in the context of sexual relationships between
adults and minors. Stallman repeats this pattern many times over the years &amp;ndash; we
see it again in Stallman&amp;rsquo;s widely criticized defense of Cody Wilson:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cody Wilson has been charged with hiring a &amp;ldquo;child&amp;rdquo; sex worker. Her age has
not been announced, but I think she must surely be a teenager, not a child.
Calling teenagers &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rdquo; in this context is a way of smearing people with
normal sexual proclivities as &amp;ldquo;perverts&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20180924231708/https://stallman.org/archives/2018-jul-oct.html#23_September_2018_(Cody_Wilson)&#34;&gt;stallman.org, 23 September 2018 &amp;ldquo;Cody Wilson&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And once more when defending Roy Moore:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senate candidate Roy Moore tried to start dating/sexual relationships with
teenagers some decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He tried to lead Ms Corfman step by step into sex, but he always respected
&amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; from her and his other dates. Thus, Moore does not deserve the
exaggerated condemnation that he is receiving for this. As an example of
exaggeration: one mailing referred to these teenagers as &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rdquo;, even the
one that was 18 years old. Many teenagers are minors, but none of them are
children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The condemnation is surely sparked by the political motive of wanting to
defeat Moore in the coming election, but it draws fuel from ageism and the
fashion for overprotectiveness of &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20180104112431/https://www.stallman.org/archives/2017-nov-feb.html#27_November_2017_(Roy_Moore&#39;s_relationships)&#34;&gt;stallman.org, 27 November 2017 &amp;ldquo;Roy Moore&amp;rsquo;s relationships&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Corfman was 14 at the time Roy Moore is accused of initiating sexual contact
with her; Moore was 32 at the time. Here we see an example of him re-iterating
his definition of &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rdquo;, a distinction he draws especially to suggest that
an adult having sex with a minor is socially acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that Stallman refers to Ms. Corfman as Moore&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;date&amp;rdquo;. Stallman&amp;rsquo;s use of
this word is important: here he normalizes the possibility that a minor and an
adult could engage in a healthy dating relationship. In this statement, Stallman
cites an article which explains circumstances which do not resemble such a
normalized dating experience: Moore isolated Corfman from her mother, drove her
directly to his home, and initiated sexual contact there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note also that the use of the phrase &amp;ldquo;step by step&amp;rdquo; in this quotation is more
commonly referred to as &amp;ldquo;grooming&amp;rdquo; in the discourse on child sexual
exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stallman reaches for similar reasoning in other political notes, such as the
following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A British woman is on trial for going to a park and inviting teenage boys to
have sex with her there. Her husband acted as a lookout in case someone else
passed by. One teenager allegedly visited her at her house repeatedly to have
sex with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these acts would be wrong in any sense, provided they took precautions
against spreading infections. The idea that adolescents (of whatever sex) need
to be &amp;ldquo;protected&amp;rdquo; from sexual experience they wish to have is prudish
ignorantism, and making that experience a crime is perverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20170612074722/http://stallman.org/archives/2017-mar-jun.html#26_May_2017_(Prudish_ignorantism)&#34;&gt;stallman.org, 26 May 2017, &amp;ldquo;Prudish ignorantism&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman in question, aged 60, had sex with her husband, age 69, in a public
space, and invited spectators as young as 11 to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stallman has also sought to normalize adult attraction to minors, literally
describing it as &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; in September 2018:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling teenagers &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rdquo; encourages treating teenagers as children, a
harmful practice which retards their development into capable adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the effect of that mislabeling is to smear Wilson. It is rare,
and considered perverse, for adults to be physically attracted to children.
However, it is normal for adults to be physically attracted to adolescents.
Since the claims about Wilson is the latter, it is wrong to present it as the
former.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stallman.org/archives/2018-sep-dec.html#23_September_2018_(Cody_Wilson)&#34;&gt;stallman.org, 23 September 2018, &amp;ldquo;Cody Wilson&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One month prior, Stallman made a statement which similarly normalized adult
attraction to minors, and suggests that acting on this attraction should be
acceptable to society, likening opposition to this view to homosexual conversion
therapy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This accords with the view that Stendhal reported in France in the 1800s,
that a woman&amp;rsquo;s most beautiful years were from 16 to 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this attitude on men&amp;rsquo;s part is normal, the author still wants to
present it as wrong or perverted, and implicitly demands men somehow control
their attraction to direct it elsewhere. Which is as absurd, and as
potentially oppressive, as claiming that homosexuals should control their
attraction and direct it towards to the other sex. Will men be pressured to
undergo &amp;ldquo;age conversion therapy&amp;rdquo; intended to brainwash them to feel attracted
mainly to women of their own age?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20180911075211/https://www.stallman.org/archives/2018-jul-oct.html#21_August_2018_(Age_and_attraction)&#34;&gt;stallman.org, 21 August 2018, &amp;ldquo;Age and attraction&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trend is thus clearly seen in Stallman&amp;rsquo;s regular political notes, over several
years, wherein Stallman re-iterates his position that &amp;ldquo;adolescents&amp;rdquo; or
&amp;ldquo;teenagers&amp;rdquo; are distinct from &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rdquo; for the purpose of having sex with
adults, and normalizes and defends adult attraction to minors and adults who
perform sexual acts with minors. We see this distinction of the two groups,
children and adolescents, outlined again on his &amp;ldquo;anti-glossary&amp;rdquo;, which still
published on his website today, albeit without the connotations of sex. His
regular insistence on a definition of children which excludes adolescents
serves such that his redaction of his controversial 2013 comment serves to
redact none of the other widely-condemned comments he has made since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stallman has often written political notes when people accused of sexual
impropriety, particularly with minors, appear in the news, or appear among
Stallman&amp;rsquo;s social circle. Stallman&amp;rsquo;s comments generally downplay the abuse and
manipulate language in a manner which benefits perpetrators of abuse. We see
this downplaying in another example from 2019:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should we accept stretching the terms &amp;ldquo;sexual abuse&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;molestation&amp;rdquo; to
include looking without touching?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not accept it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stallman.org/archives/2019-may-aug.html#11_June_2019_(Stretching_meaning_of_terms)&#34;&gt;stallman.org, 11 June 2019 &amp;ldquo;Stretching meaning of terms&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stallman is writing here in response to a news article outlining accusations of
sexual misconduct directed at Ohio State athletics doctor Richard Strauss.
Strauss was accused of groping at least 177 students between 1979 and 1997
during routine physical exams, accusations corroborated by at least 50 members
of the athletic department staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Stallman&amp;rsquo;s regular fixation of the use of the word &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rdquo;
with respect to sex, this political note also draws our attention to the next
linguistic fixation of Stallman I want to question: the use of phrases like
&amp;ldquo;sexual abuse&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sexual assault&amp;rdquo;. The term &amp;ldquo;sexual assault&amp;rdquo; also appears in
Stallman&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Anti-glossary&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sexual assault: The term is applied to a broad range of actions, from rape on
one end, to the least physical contact on the other, as well as everything in
between. It acts as propaganda for treating them all the same. That would be
wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term is further stretched to include sexual harassment, which does not
refer to a single act, but rather to a series of acts that amounts to a form
of gender bias. Gender bias is rightly prohibited in certain situations for
the sake of equal opportunity, but that is a different issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think that rape should be treated the same as a momentary touch.
People we accuse have a right to those distinctions, so I am careful not to
use the term &amp;ldquo;sexual assault&amp;rdquo; to categorize the actions of any person on any
specific occasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stallman.org/antiglossary.html&#34;&gt;stallman.org, &amp;ldquo;Anti-glossary&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stallman often fixates on the term &amp;ldquo;sexual assault&amp;rdquo; throughout his political
notes. He feels that the term fails to distinguish between &amp;ldquo;grave&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;minor&amp;rdquo;
crimes, as he illustrated in 2021:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sexual assault&amp;rdquo; is so vague that it makes no sense as a charge. Because of
that term, we can&amp;rsquo;t whether these journalists were accused of a grave crime
or a minor one. However, the charge of espionage shows this is political
persecution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a href=&#34;https://stallman.org/archives/2021-jul-oct.html#21_July_2021_(Imprisonment_of_journalists)&#34;&gt;stallman.org, 21 July 2021, &amp;ldquo;Imprisonment of journalists&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to find out what kind of crimes Stallman feels the need to
distinguish along this axis. His other political notes give us some hints,
such as this one regarding Al Franken&amp;rsquo;s sexual misconduct scandal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it is true that he persistently pressured her to kiss him, on stage and
off, if he stuck his tongue into her mouth despite her objections, that could
well be sexual harassment. He should have accepted no for an answer the first
time she said it. However, calling a kiss &amp;ldquo;sexual assault&amp;rdquo; is an exaggeration,
an attempt to equate it to much graver acts, that are crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;ldquo;sexual assault&amp;rdquo; encourages that injustice, and I believe it has been
popularized specifically with that intention. That is why I reject that term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20190801201704/https://stallman.org/archives/2019-may-aug.html#30_July_2019_(Al_Franken)&#34;&gt;stallman.org, 30 July 2019, &amp;ldquo;Al Franken&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stallman also wrote in 2020 to question the use of the phrase again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the US, when thugs&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; rape people they say are suspects, it is
rare to bring them to justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I object to describing any one crime as &amp;ldquo;sexual assault&amp;rdquo; because that is vague
about the severity of the crime. This article often uses that term to refer to
many crimes that differ in severity but raise the same issue. That may be a
valid practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a href=&#34;https://stallman.org/notes/2020-jul-oct.html#12_August_2020_(When_thugs_rape_people_they_say_are_suspects)&#34;&gt;stallman.org, 12 August 2020, &amp;ldquo;When thugs rape people they say are suspects&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the article Stallman cites in this political note, various unwelcome sexual
acts by the police are described, the least severe of which is probably
molestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More alarmingly, Stallman addresses his views on the term &amp;ldquo;sexual assault&amp;rdquo; in
this 2017 note, affording for the possibility that a 35-year-old man could have
had consensual sex with an 11-year-old girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jelani Maraj (who I had never heard of) could be imprisoned for a long time
for &amp;ldquo;sexual assault&amp;rdquo;. What does that concretely mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the vagueness of the term &amp;ldquo;sexual assault&amp;rdquo; together with the dishonest
law that labels sex with adolescents as &amp;ldquo;rape&amp;rdquo; even if they are willing, we
cannot tell from this article what sort of acts Maraj was found to have
committed. So we can&amp;rsquo;t begin to judge whether those acts were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see at least three possibilities. Perhaps those acts really constituted
rape — it is a possibility. Or perhaps the two had sex willingly, but her
parents freaked out and demanded prosecution. Or, intermediate between those
two, perhaps he pressured her into having sex, or got her drunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a href=&#34;https://stallman.org/archives/2017-nov-feb.html#13_November_2017_(Jelani_Maraj)&#34;&gt;stallman.org, 13 November 2017, &amp;ldquo;Jelani Maraj&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another article by Stallman does not explicitly refer to sexual assault, but
does engage in a bizarre defense of a journalist who was fired for masturbating
during a video conference. In this article Stallman fixates on questions such as
whether or not the genitals being in view of the webcam was intentional or not,
and suggests that masturbating on a video call would be acceptable should the
genitals remain unseen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Yorker&amp;rsquo;s unpublished note to staff was vague about its grounds for
firing Toobin. Indeed, it did not even acknowledge that he had been fired.
This is unfair, like convicting someone on unstated charges. Something didn&amp;rsquo;t
meet its &amp;ldquo;standards of conduct&amp;rdquo;, but it won&amp;rsquo;t tell us what — we can only
guess. What are the possibilities? Intentionally engaging in video-call sex as
a side activity during a work meeting? If he had not made a mistake in keeping
that out of view of the coworkers, why would it make a difference what the
side activity was?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stallman.org/articles/toobin.html&#34;&gt;stallman.org, November 2020, &amp;ldquo;On the Firing of Jeffrey Toobin&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Stallman elaborated on his thoughts on the term most recently in
October 2023. This note gives the clearest view of Stallman&amp;rsquo;s preferred
distinction between various sexual crimes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I warned that the stretchable term &amp;ldquo;sexual assault&amp;rdquo;, which extends from grave
crimes such as rape through significant crimes such as groping and down to no
clear lower bound, could be stretched to criminalize minor things, perhaps
even stealing a kiss. Now this has happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What next? Will a pat on the arm or a hug be criminalized? There is no clear
limit to how far this can go, when a group builds up enough outrage to push
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stallman.org/archives/2023-sep-dec.html#15_October_2023_(Sexual_assault_for_stealing_a_kiss)&#34;&gt;stallman.org, 15 October 2023, &amp;ldquo;Sexual assault for stealing a kiss&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Stallman&amp;rsquo;s statements, we can refine his objection to the term &amp;ldquo;sexual
assault&amp;rdquo;, and sexual behaviors generally, to further suggest that the following
beliefs are held by Stallman on the subject:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Groping and molestation are not sexual assault, but are crimes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kissing someone without consent is not sexual assault, furthermore it is not wrong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Masturbating during a video conference is not wrong if you are not seen doing so&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 35-year-old man having sex with an 11-year-old girl does not constitute
rape, nor sexual assault, but is in fact conscionable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last of these may be covered under Stallman&amp;rsquo;s 2019 retraction, even
accounting for Stallman&amp;rsquo;s unconventional use of the word &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stallman&amp;rsquo;s fixation on the term &amp;ldquo;sexual assault&amp;rdquo; can be understood in his
political notes as having the political aims of eroding the meaning of the
phrase, questioning the boundaries of consent, downplaying the importance of
agency in intimate interactions, appealing for the defense of people accused of
sexual assault, and arguing for sexual relationships between minors and adults
to be normalized. In one notable case, he has used this political angle to rise
to the defense of his friends &amp;ndash; in Stallman&amp;rsquo;s infamous email regarding Marvin
Minsky, he writes the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The injustice [done to Minsky] is in the word “assaulting”. The term “sexual
assault” is so vague and slippery that it facilitates accusation inflation:
taking claims that someone did X and leading people to think of it as Y, which
is much worse than X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word “assaulting” presumes that he applied force or violence, in some
unspecified way, but the article itself says no such thing. Only that they had
sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can imagine many scenarios, but the most plausible scenario is that she
presented herself to him as entirely willing. Assuming she was being coerced
by Epstein, he would have had every reason to tell her to conceal that from
most of his associates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve concluded from various examples of accusation inflation that it is
absolutely wrong to use the term “sexual assault” in an accusation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— Excerpt from &lt;a href=&#34;https://scribe.rip/medium.com/@selamie/remove-richard-stallman-fec6ec210794&#34;&gt;Selam G&amp;rsquo;s recount of Stallman&amp;rsquo;s email&lt;/a&gt; to MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory mailing list, September 2019. Selam&amp;rsquo;s quotation has been corroborated by other sources.
Minsky is, in this context, accused of having had a sexual encounter with a
minor facilitated by convicted child trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. The original
accusation does not state that this sexual encounter actually occurred; only
that the minor in question was instructed to have sex with Minsky. Minsky would
have been at least 75 years old at the time of the alleged incident; the minor
was 16.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an important, but more subtle pattern in Stallman&amp;rsquo;s statements that I
want to draw your attention to here: Stallman appears to have little to no
understanding of the role of power dynamics in sexual harassment, assault, and
rape. Stallman appears to reject the supposition that these acts could occur
without an element of outwardly apparent violent coercion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is most obviously evidenced by his statements regarding the sexual abuse of
minors; most people understand that minors cannot consent to sex even if they
&amp;ldquo;appear willing&amp;rdquo;, in particular because an adult in this situation is exploiting
a difference in experience and maturity to manipulate the child into sexually
satisfying them &amp;ndash; in other words, a power differential. Stallman seems to
reject this understanding of consent in his various defenses of people accused
of sexual impropriety with minors, and in cases where the pretense of consent
cannot be easily established, he offers the perpetrator the benefit of the
doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also find an example of Stallman disregarding power dynamics with respect
to adults in the following political note from 2017:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A famous theater director had a habit of pestering women, asking them for sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell from this article, he didn&amp;rsquo;t try to force women into sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When women persistently said no, he does not seem to have tried to punish them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most he did was ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was a pest, but nothing worse than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;— &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20180131020215/https://stallman.org/archives/2017-jul-oct.html#29_October_2017_(Pestering_women)&#34;&gt;stallman.org, 29 October 2017, &amp;ldquo;Pestering women&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case we have an example of &amp;ldquo;quid pro quo&amp;rdquo;, a kind of sexual harassment
which weaponizes power dynamics for sexual gratification. This kind of sexual
harassment is explicitly cited as illegal by Title VII of the US Civil Rights
Act. A lack of competence in this respect displayed by Stallman, whose position
in the Free Software Foundation board of directors requires that he act in a
manner consistent with this law, is alarming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have identified this blindness to power dynamics as a recurring theme in
Stallman&amp;rsquo;s comments on sexual abuse, be it with respect to sexual relationships
between minors and adults, managers and subordinates, students and teachers, or
public figures and their audience. I note for the reader that Stallman has held
and currently holds several of these positions of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to his position as a voting member of the Free Software Foundation&amp;rsquo;s
Board of Directors, Stallman is still invited to speak at events and
conferences. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ddol/rre-rms/blob/master/fulltext/20111018.txt&#34;&gt;Stallman&amp;rsquo;s infamous rider&lt;/a&gt; prescribes a number of his
requirements for attending an event; most of his conditions are relatively
reasonable, though amusing. In this document, he states his preference for being
accommodated in private, on a &amp;ldquo;spare couch&amp;rdquo;, when he travels. At these events,
in these private homes, he may be afforded many opportunities to privacy with
vulnerable people, including minors that, in his view, can consent to having sex
with adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, Stallman has a well-documented and oft-professed set of political
beliefs which reject the social and legal norms regarding consent. He is not
simply quietly misled in these beliefs; rather he advocates for these values
using his political platform. He has issued no meaningful retractions of these
positions or apologies for harm caused, and has continued to pursue a similar
agenda since his return to the FSF board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a toxic environment not only in the Free Software Foundation and in
Stallman&amp;rsquo;s direct purview, but in the broader Free Software movement. The free
software movement is culturally poisoned by our support of Stallman as our
ideological leader. The open letter calling for Stallman&amp;rsquo;s removal received
3,000 signatures; the counter-letter in support of Stallman received 6,876
before it stopped accepting submissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Stallman founded the Free Software Foundation in 1985, and has performed
innumerable works to the benefit of our community since then. We&amp;rsquo;ve taken
Stallman&amp;rsquo;s views on software freedom seriously, and they&amp;rsquo;ve led us to great
achievements. It is to Stallman&amp;rsquo;s credit that the Free Software community is
larger than one man. However, one&amp;rsquo;s political qualifications to speak about free
software does not make one qualified to address matters of sex; in this respect
Stallman&amp;rsquo;s persistence presents as dangerous incompetence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we consider his speech on sex as a discourse that has been crafted and
rehearsed methodically over the years, he asks us to consider him seriously, and
so we must. When we analyze the dangerous patterns in this discourse, we have to
conclude that he is not fit for purpose in his leadership role, and we must
acknowledge the shadow that our legitimization of his discourse casts on our
community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stallman consistently refers to police officers as &amp;ldquo;thugs&amp;rdquo; in his
writing; see Stallman&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://stallman.org/glossary.html&#34;&gt;Glossary&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://drewdevault.com/2023/11/09/Can-I-be-on-your-podcast.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am working on rousing the &lt;a href=&#34;https://harelang.org&#34;&gt;Hare&lt;/a&gt; community to get the
word out about our work. I have drafted the &lt;a href=&#34;https://harelang.org/evangelism/&#34;&gt;Hare evangelism&lt;/a&gt; guidelines to
this effect, which summarizes how we want to see our community bringing Hare to
more people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;d like to spread the word in a way which is respectful of the attention of
others &amp;ndash; we&amp;rsquo;re explicitly eschewing unsolicited prompts for projects to
consider writing/rewriting in Hare, as well as any paid sponsorships or
advertising. Blog posts about Hare, videos, participating in (organic) online
discussions &amp;ndash; much better! And one idea we have is to talk about Hare on
podcasts which might be interested in the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that describes your podcast, here&amp;rsquo;s my bold request: can I make an
appearance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some mini &amp;ldquo;press kits&amp;rdquo; to give you a hook and some information that
might be useful for preparing an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-hare-programming-language&#34;&gt;The Hare programming language&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hare is a systems programming language designed to be simple, stable, and
robust. Hare uses a static type system, manual memory management, and a
minimal runtime. It is well-suited to writing operating systems, system tools,
compilers, networking software, and other low-level, high performance tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hare has been in development since late 2019 and today has about 100
contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On &#34;real name&#34; policies</title>
      <link>https://drewdevault.com/2023/10/31/On-real-names.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://drewdevault.com/2023/10/31/On-real-names.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some free software projects reject anonymous or pseudonymous contributions,
requiring you to author patches using your &amp;ldquo;real name&amp;rdquo;. Such projects have a
so-called &amp;ldquo;real name&amp;rdquo; policy; Linux is one well-known example.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The root motivations behind such policies vary, but in my experience the most
often cited rationale is that it&amp;rsquo;s important to establish the provenance of the
contribution for copyright reasons. In the case of Linux, contributors are asked
to &amp;ldquo;sign-off&amp;rdquo; their commits to indicate their agreement to the terms of the
Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO), which includes clauses like the
following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the right to
submit it under the open source license indicated in the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To some extent, the DCO serves as a legal assertion of copyright and an
agreement to license a work under given copyright terms (GPLv2 in the case of
Linux). This record also means that the author of the code is accountable in
case the copyright is challenged; in the case of an anonymous or pseudonymous
contributor you&amp;rsquo;re shit out of luck. At that point, liability over the
disagreement would likely fall into the hands of the maintainer that accepted
the contribution. It is reasonable for a maintainer to ask a contributor to
assert their copyright and accept liability over the provenance of their code in
a legally meaningful and accountable form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibility that someone may have something useful to offer to a free
software project, but is not comfortable disclosing their name for any number of
reasons, is a reasonable supposition. A maintainer whose &amp;ldquo;real name&amp;rdquo; policy is
challenged on this basis would also be reasonable in saying &amp;ldquo;I feel for you, but
I cannot agree to accept legal liability over the provenance of this code,
nor can I communicate that risk to end-users who acquire code under a license
that may or may not be valid as such&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Real name&amp;rdquo; policies are controversial in the free software community. I open
with this perspective in an attempt to cool down the room. Those who feel
marginalized by &amp;ldquo;real name&amp;rdquo; policies often skew young, and many treat matters
such as copyright and licensing with disdain. Moreover, the problem tends to
inflame deeply hurtful sentiments and raise thorny matters of identity and
discrimination, and it&amp;rsquo;s easy to construe the intent of the policymakers as the
intent to cause harm. The motivations behind these policies are reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, intent or otherwise, these policies can cause harm. The profile of
the contributor who is comfortable using their &amp;ldquo;real name&amp;rdquo; is likely to fall
more narrowly into over-represented demographics in our community; enforcing a
real-name policy will ostracize some people. Those with marginalized identities
tend to be less comfortable with disclosing their &amp;ldquo;real name&amp;rdquo;. Someone who has
been subject to harassment may not be comfortable with this disclosure, since it
offers more fuel to harassers keeping tabs on their activities. The use of a
&amp;ldquo;real name&amp;rdquo; also confers a gender bias; avoiding a &amp;ldquo;real name&amp;rdquo; policy neatly
eliminates discrimination on this basis. Of course, there are also many
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/&#34;&gt;falsehoods programmers believe about names&lt;/a&gt; which can present in the
implementation of such a policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also one particular problem which has been at the heart of conflict
surrounding the use of &amp;ldquo;real-name&amp;rdquo; policies in free software: transgender
identities. A transgender person is likely to change their name in the process
of assuming their new identity. When this happens, their real name changes.
However, it may or may not match their legal name &amp;ndash; some trans people opt to
change it, others don&amp;rsquo;t; if they do it is a process that takes time. Meanwhile,
addressing a trans person by their old name, or &amp;ldquo;deadname&amp;rdquo;, is highly
uncomfortable. Doing so deliberately, as a matter of policy or otherwise, is a
form of discrimination. Many trans people experience deliberate &amp;ldquo;deadnaming&amp;rdquo; as
a form of harassment in their daily lives, and institutionalizing this behavior
is cruel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, managing the names of participants is more challenging than anyone
would like. On the one hand, names establish accountability and facilitate
collaboration, and importantly, credit the authors of a work for services
performed. On the other hand, names are highly personal and deeply affecting,
and their usage and changes over time are the subject of important consideration
at the discretion of their owner. A complicating factor is that handling names
properly introduces technical problems which must be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To embrace the advantages of &amp;ldquo;real name&amp;rdquo; policies &amp;ndash; establishing provenance,
encouraging accountability, fostering a social environment &amp;ndash; without causing
harm, the approach I have settled on for my projects is to use the DCO to
establish provenance and encourage contributors to sign-off and participate
under the identity they feel most comfortable with. I encourage people to
utilize an identity they use beyond the project&amp;rsquo;s walls, to foster a social
environment and a connection to the broader community, to establish
accountability, and to ensure that participants are reachable for further
discussion on their work. If a contributor&amp;rsquo;s identity changes, we make every
effort to support this change in contemporary, future, and historical use.&lt;/p&gt;
