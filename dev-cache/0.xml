I love getting reader mail, but can no longer reply to everything. I read absolutely everything. You can reach me at: ludicity.hackernews@gmail.com.

I will prioritize responding, in order, if:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You live in Melbourne and want coffee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to invite me onto a podcast or something because the flames of my ego are a roaring inferno that needs constant feeding, to the dismay of all those around me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are a student seeking advice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are an unemployed engineer that shares my values who needs help, especially from marginalized communities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Podcast which is just me chatting with readers and friends.

Mastodon because it's so much nicer than Twitter.

Twitter which only exists so that I can comment on posts whenever I'm featured on a podcast, which is not a sentence I ever expected to type.

Sunlight filters through my windows, illuminating swirling motes of dust across my living room. There is a cup of tea in my hand. I take a sip and savor it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I text the other senior engineer, who unlike me is full-time, on the team: "I'm ready to start at 10", as is our custom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minute hand moves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is 10:00 AM in Melbourne, 9th October, 2024. The sun is immediately extinguished and replaced by a shrieking skull hanging low in a frigid sky. I glance down at my tea, and it is as blood. I take a sip and savor it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I text the other senior engineer on the team: "Are you ready to enter the Pain Zone?"&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, as is our custom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i-the-pain-zone"&gt;I. The Pain Zone&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pain Zone, coated in grass which rends those who tread upon it like a legion of upraised spears, is an enterprise data warehouse platform. At the small scale we operate at, with little loss of detail, a &lt;em&gt;data warehouse platform&lt;/em&gt; simply means that we copy a bunch of text files from different systems into a single place every morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word &lt;em&gt;enterprise&lt;/em&gt; means that we do this in a way that makes people say "Dear God, why would anyone ever design it that way?", "But that doesn't even help with security" and "Everyone involved should be fired for the sake of all that is holy and pure."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the architecture diagram which describes how we copy text files to our storage location has &lt;em&gt;one hundred and four&lt;/em&gt; separate operations on it. When I went to count this, I was expecting to write &lt;em&gt;forty&lt;/em&gt; and that was meant to illustrate my point. Instead, I ended up counting them up three times because there was &lt;em&gt;no way&lt;/em&gt; it could be over a hundred. This whole thing should have ten operations in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retrieve file. Validate file. Save file. Log what you did. Those could all be one point on the diagram, but I'm being generous. And you can keep the extra six points for stuff I forgot. That's ten. Why are there &lt;em&gt;a hundred and four&lt;/em&gt;? Sweet merciful Christ, why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At two of the four businesses I've worked at, the most highly-performing engineers have resorted to something that I think of as Pain Zone navigation. It's the practice of never working unless pair programming simply to have someone next to you, bolstering your resolve, so that you can gaze upon the horrors of the Pain Zone without immediately losing your mind. Of course, no code alone can make people this afraid of work. Code is, ultimately, characters on a screen, and software engineers do nothing but hammer that code into shapes that spark Joy and Money. The fear and dread comes from a culture where people feel &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; that they can't work quickly enough in the terrible codebase, where they feel &lt;em&gt;judged&lt;/em&gt; for slowing down to hammer the code into better shapes that sadly aren't on the Jira board, and where management looks down on people who practice craftsmanship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last doesn't even require malicious management — it just needs people that don't respect how deep craftsmanship can go. These are the same people that do not appreciate that an expert pianist is not simply pressing keys, they are obsessively perfecting timing and the force applied to each key, alongside dozens of factors that I can't comprehend. An unthoughtful person will see something and think "It can't be that hard" or more generously "That looks quite hard" . The &lt;em&gt;respectful&lt;/em&gt; thought to have when viewing any competent professional in a foreign domain, in &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; domain that I'm aware of, is "That must be way harder than it looks."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have now seen enough workplaces, and thanks to the blog have access to enough executives, to know that this is what most cultures degenerate into. Terrible companies are perpetual cognitohazards where everyone is bullied all day. The &lt;em&gt;median&lt;/em&gt; companies (which some people call "good" for lack of ever having seen better) lack the outright bullying but still consist of people that are trying to convince themselves that it's &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt; to feel disempowered or subservient all day. There are times in my life where I have to deal with this, but it is hardly &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; are places where you can get at least &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of the things that a person needs other than rent money&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This place has a better culture than most, as bullying is &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; not tolerated, we have fully remote work, and it is a terrible faux pas to accuse someone of not working fast enough outright, though you can hint at it gently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worse than most places at software engineering, as... oh, you'll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I have a deal with the team. Every morning, grab your coffee, attend your meetings, and at 10 AM we navigate the Pain Zone together for at least three to four hours. Management is blissfully unaware that this force of camaraderie and mutual psychotherapy is the only way that things continue to limp along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-i-am-lost-to-the-pain-zone"&gt;II. I Am Lost To The Pain Zone&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have one simple job today. The organization wants to know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is data coming into our system?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is any data being lost?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each data source goes through approximately thirteen steps on average — how many are getting stuck along the way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone has already landed all of the logs our system produces in the data warehouse, so we can examine them in there, alongside the actual data. Is that smart? I dunno, something feels a bit weird about it &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; I have no concrete objection. My co-navigator and I decide to look at the logs for one data source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where, five seconds in, we begin to become lost in the Pain Zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say the data source we picked was "Google Analytics". We search the landed logs for Google Analytics, expecting to see something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=""&gt;Source&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=""&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what I actually see in the source column, and yes, it actually looked exactly this bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=""&gt;Source&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=""&gt;6g94-8jjf-eo84757h4758z", "jobStatus": "JobStatus.Waiting", "jobExpiry":"2023-10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That... is not "Google Analytics". In fact, what the fuck is that? It looks like someone has dumped a random snippet of JSON into the logs, but not even the entirety of the JSON. The strings aren't terminated. We should have around fifty source systems, so how many distinct source systems appear in—  &lt;em&gt;FIFTY-SEVEN THOUSAND?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've been writing &lt;em&gt;total nonsense&lt;/em&gt; to half the logs for &lt;em&gt;over a year&lt;/em&gt; and no one noticed? We only have &lt;em&gt;two jobs&lt;/em&gt;. Get the data and log that we got the data. But the logs are nonsense, so we aren't doing the second thing, and because the logs are nonsense &lt;em&gt;I don't know if we've been doing the first thing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take a deep breath. The plan is to submit my notice on &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/quitting-my-job-for-the-way-of-pain/"&gt;December 2nd&lt;/a&gt; anyway, so this is fine. This is so &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt;. The other engineers already know I'm leaving, and we've all committed to do the best we can for two months for our spiritual growth. The ability to do painful things is a virtuous skill to cultivate as a responsible adult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, how is this happening? Well, it turns out that we're embedding a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; amount of metadata in filenames, and the Lambda functions that produce all of this — of course, we're serverless, because how can you hurt yourself without a cutting-edge? — use lots of regex to extract data. Unfortunately, because we don't have any tests, someone eventually wrote some code to download data that passed a big JSON blob instead of a filename to the logging function, and that function happily went "Great, I'll just regex out the source system from the file name!" Except it wasn't a filename, so it has instead spewed garbage into the system for months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find something like this &lt;em&gt;every time&lt;/em&gt; we enter the Pain Zone. Sometimes we've laughed so hard that we've &lt;em&gt;cried&lt;/em&gt; at the things we've seen $2,000 per day consultants do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue is raised with the team, but because fixing this critical error in our auditability is not on the board and &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/tossed-salads-and-scrumbled-eggs/"&gt;Velocity Must Be Up&lt;/a&gt;, fixing the logs is judged to be less important than... parsing... the nonsense logs. Why? We have another saying on our team, which is "Stop asking questions, you're only going to hurt yourself".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take another deep breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, we'll continue with the work instead of fixing the critical production error. We can't query the Google Analytics stuff based on source system, so let's pick another one. We also draw data from Twitter once every two hours, and that source column isn't broken for that. I just need to be able to associate the log events to begin working on that. That is, we'll have one log that says "I downloaded the data from Twitter" and another log that says "I checked that it had all the correct stuff in it", and I just have to tie them together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't like the way this table is configured for various reasons, but I'm expecting to see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=""&gt;Event ID&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=""&gt;Source&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=""&gt;Event&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=""&gt;Success&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=""&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=""&gt;Twitter&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=""&gt;Downloaded&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=""&gt;True&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=""&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=""&gt;Twitter&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=""&gt;Validated&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=""&gt;True&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I can just do something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;select
  event,
  success
from
  log_table
where event_id = 1 and source = 'twitter'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I can see if all the correct stuff happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I cannot find an event_id column or anything that looks like one. I hit up the expert on this system, and am informed that I should use the &lt;code&gt;awslog&lt;/code&gt; column. I look at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=""&gt;awslog&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=""&gt;converted/twitter/retweets_per_post/year=2023/month=03/day=11/retweets_per_post_fact-00045-8b3226g9.txt | Validated&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, firstly, what the fuck is this? Secondly, what the &lt;em&gt;fuck&lt;/em&gt; is this? Thirdly, well, you get it. Why not just store this in a relational format? Why are they all in one column? Why do you hate me specifically?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop asking questions, you're only going to hurt yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am expected to use regular expressions &lt;em&gt;to construct a key in my query&lt;/em&gt;. As far as I can tell, the numbers and letters don't represent or uniquely identify anything, they've really just been appended for no reason. I waste a fair amount of time figuring out if I can use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;December 2nd, I tell myself. Of course, I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be working on a book, shipping a hobby project, and dedicating more time to the business we're committing to in January, but December 2nd was the plan. It will be a great exercise to come up with a plan to gradually refactor all of this while delivering the things we're supposed to. It will make me a better engineer. December 2nd, December 2nd, hold fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-im-out"&gt;III. I'm Out&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, we can write a regular expression to identify all Twitter sources that came from 11/03/2023. This is very stupid, but compared to minimum wage in my home country, I am being compensated &lt;em&gt;spectacularly&lt;/em&gt; to deal with this particular brand of stupidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait, we retrieve this once every two hours, which means that while I can find all the Twitter data pulls from the 11th, I can't actually tell which rows are associated with the 8 AM run versus the 2 PM run. This perplexing awslog column only identifies things down to the &lt;em&gt;day&lt;/em&gt;, not the hour. We have another column that logs the exact time down to the second that a Lambda function has fired, but each step happens at a slightly different time, and each source takes different amounts of time based on filesize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I message the team. "Any ideas for how to identify specific runs that don't assume there is only one run per day?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We take a ten minute break. We return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am informed that there is no way to do this. All I can think of is to create a heuristic &lt;em&gt;per data source&lt;/em&gt;, such that I see when the file was acquired then scan for the validation event that happens closest to the acquisition event without going so far ahead that I read the &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; successful validation event by mistake. &lt;em&gt;I just wanted to see if data was landing in the platform&lt;/em&gt;. And to make things worse, I suddenly remember that I've seen this awslog thing before. A month after I joined the business, I saw it, and I said that it was unacceptably bad. The response was that it's okay because all the data we want is technically inside those strings, and this design is more &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/flexible-schemas-are-the-mindkiller/"&gt;flexible&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, since then we've added our first data source that is downloaded more than once a day, so it turns out, shockingly, that they should have Just Used Postgres and not tried to be excessively clever. As always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How have we been running things like this for &lt;em&gt;two years&lt;/em&gt;? Millions of dollars were spent on this system. Our CTO, who has never written code themselves, gets on stages every few months and just &lt;em&gt;lies to people&lt;/em&gt; about things that the CTO can't possibly understand, pretending that any of this works and that they're a leader in the space. Then their friends buy the same software — I know because recruiters keep calling to ask me if I'll help lead the efforts. Almost every large business in Melbourne is rushing to purchase our tooling, tools like Snowflake and Databricks, because the industry is pretending that any of this is more important than hiring competent people and treating them well. I could build something superior to this with an ancient laptop, an internet connection, and spreadsheets. It would take me a month tops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've known for a long time that I can't change things here. But in this moment, I realize that the organization values things that I don't value, and it's as simple as that. I could pretend to be neutral and say that my values aren't &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;, but you know what, my values &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; better. Having tested code is better. Having comprehensible logs is better. I'm wasting their money sitting around until December, which is unethical. I'm disrespecting myself waiting two more months for a measly Christmas break payout, which is unwise. I've even &lt;em&gt;degraded team morale&lt;/em&gt; because I've convinced some of the engineers that things should be better, but not management, so now some of the engineers are upset. I'm a net negative for this team, except for &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-accidentally-saved-half-a-million-dollars/"&gt;that one time I saved them so much money that it continues to cover all three of our managers' salaries combined&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an afterthought, the person who just informed us that we have no way to associate logs to their respective ingestion events adds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By the way, I think that there's a chance some of the logs don't actually report the right things. Like the ones that say &lt;code&gt;Validated: True&lt;/code&gt; are actually just hardcoded strings in the Lambda functions, and the people that wrote them may have meant to type in things like &lt;code&gt;File Landed: True&lt;/code&gt; but made mistakes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am dumbstruck. The other senior is laughing hysterically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is 11:30 AM in Melbourne, 9th October, 2024. The wind is a vortex of ghost-knives sending birds careening from the sky. I glance down at my tea, and it is liquid hatred. I take a sip and savor it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Hey, are you still there?", my pairing partner replies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yeah. Yeah. Listen, I'm done. I'm out today."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What? What about December?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I could get the entire terrible first draft of a whole book out by December if I wasn't wasting time on this."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"... Fair."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I briefly consider contacting my partner, but I know she'll support me. I could check in with my parents, but they'd just worry for no reason. I could chat with my co-founders, but they're just going to tell me to do what I need to do. I could sleep on it, but that would just be to give myself the illusion of responsibility even as I barrel towards wasting two more months to earn money that, thanks to five years of diligently navigating various Pain Zones, I don't even need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I resign at 2:00 PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv-blessed-freedom"&gt;IV. Blessed Freedom&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is 3:00 PM in Melbourne, 9th October, 2024. I have called my director, who is highly competent, and explained why every engineer wants to quit, and finalized the paperwork. My last day is the 5th of November, 2024. My only job title is now director of my own consultancy, and in January my savings will start to tick down. I glance down at my tea, and it is tea. I take a sip and savor it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ps"&gt;PS:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I gave a talk at GDG Melbourne which you can watch &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlf4oXoP8qI"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The audio quality is not great, so I forgive anyone who taps out. The comments are weird because I asked people to flip a coin and respond with "This guy is the next Steve Jobs" or "This guy seems like a real piece of work", which I only regret a little bit. I should not be allowed to run a business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I gave a webinar to US board members at the invitation of the Financial Times. Suffice it to say that while people are sincerely trying their best, our leaders are not even &lt;em&gt;remotely&lt;/em&gt; equipped to handle the volume of people just outright lying to them about IT. Also apparently my psychotic blog does not disqualify me from Financial Times affiliation, which is &lt;em&gt;wild&lt;/em&gt;, but is maybe a useful lesson that the world is desperate for sincerity even when it isn't dressed up as corporate maturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do actually say this every morning.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people that expect to get &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of them are probably not doing themselves any favors either.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/get-me-out-of-data-hell/</guid></item><item><title>Tossed Salads And Scrumbled Eggs</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/tossed-salads-and-scrumbled-eggs/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;With the decision to focus on our consultancy full-time in 2025, my time as an employee draws to a close. My attitude has become that of an entomologist observing a strange insect which can miraculously diagnose issues, but only if the diagnosis is "you weren't Agile enough". My rage has quickly morphed into relief because this is, broadly speaking, the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'A beetle clock?' she said. She had turned away from the glass dome.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Oh, er, yes... The Hershebian lawyer beetle has a very consistent daily routine,' said Jeremy. 'I, er, only keep it for, um, interest.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While our team is now blessedly free of both the madness of corporate dysfunction and the grotesque world of VC-funded enterprise, we must still interface with such organizations, ideally in as pleasant a manner as is possible for both parties. But there is still one question from my soon-to-be old life that bears pondering, which I must understand if I am to overcome its terrible implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the fuck is going on with all those dweebs talking about Scrum all day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i"&gt;I.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would rather cover myself in paper cuts and jump into a pool of lemon juice than attend one more standup where Amateur Alice and Blundering Bob pat each other on the back for doing absolutely fucking nothing... except using the learning stipend to get "Scrum Master Certified" on LinkedIn or whatever.&lt;br&gt;
— A reader&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be surprised to hear, &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-will-fucking-haymaker-you-if-you-mention-agile-again/"&gt;given my previous writing&lt;/a&gt;, that I am more-or-less ambivalent about the specifics of Scrum. The inevitable protestations that "Scrum works well for my team" whenever it comes up are both tedious and very much beside the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason that these protestations are tedious is that, in the environment we find ourselves navigating, these are meaningless statements without context. Most people in management roles are executing the Agile vision in totally incompetent fashion, usually conflating Scrum with Agile. They &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; think that it's going just swimmingly, when a more accurate characterization would be drowningly. Given that you do not know who you are speaking to over the internet, whether they are competent engineers or self-proclaimed thought leaders, any statement about Agile "working for my team" does not convey much information, in the same way that someone proclaiming that they are totally not guilty is generally an insufficient defense in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason that they are &lt;em&gt;beside the point&lt;/em&gt; is that the specifics of Scrum are much, much less interesting than what we can infer from the malformed version of the practice that we see spreading throughout the industry. I believe there are issues with Scrum, but those issues simply do not explain the breathtaking dysfunction in the industry writ large. Instead I believe that Scrum and the assorted mutations that it has acquired simply reflect a broader lack of understanding of the systems that drive knowledge work, and the industry has simply adopted the methodology that slots most neatly into our most widely-held misconceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-oh-baby-i-hear-the-blues-a-callin"&gt;II. Oh Baby, I Hear The Blues A-Callin'&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I am not a data engineer like yourself, but we share the deep belief that Scrum is complete and utter bullcrap.&lt;br&gt;
— A reader&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first entered the industry, I was at a large institution that had recently decided to become more Agile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth taking the time to explain what this means for the non-technicians in the audience, both so that they can follow what is going on, and so that the technicians here can develop an appreciation for how fucking nuts this all sounds when you explain it to someone with some distance. Most of us are so deeply immersed in this lunacy that we no longer have full context on how bizarre this all is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin with, "Agile" is a term for a massive industry around productivity related to software engineering. Astute adults, with no further context, will see the phrase "industry around productivity" and become appropriately alarmed. The industry is replete with Agile consultants, Agile coaches, Agile gurus, and Agile thought leaders. Note that these are all the same thing at different points on the narcissism axis. Agile is actually a philosophy with no concrete implementation details, so there are management methodologies that claim to be inspired by that broader philosophy. The most popular one is called Scrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any project management methodology, the dream goal with Scrum is for teams to work more quickly, to respond to changes in the business more rapidly, and to provide reliable estimates so that projects do not end up in dependency hell. This is typically accomplished through Jira. All-powerful Jira! All-knowing Jira! What is this miraculous Jira? It's a website that simulates a board of sticky notes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="An image of a Jira board, which is a series of columns containing cards, with the leftmost column being labelled &amp;quot;To Do&amp;quot; and the rightmost being &amp;quot;Done&amp;quot;" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/27e44ad2.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it, that's the whole thing. When something needs to be done, you put it in there and communicate on the card. Well, all right, that doesn't sound so bad yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, this is paired with a meeting that runs every morning, called a Stand-Up. It is supposed to run for approximately ten minutes, as one would expect for a meeting that's going to happen &lt;em&gt;every day&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, every team I've seen running Scrum has this meeting go on for an hour. Yikes, yes, daily one hour meeting. And since orthodoxy in the modern business world is that a "silo" is bad&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, many people work on more than one team, so they attend &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; one hour meetings &lt;em&gt;per day&lt;/em&gt;. That is a full 25% of an organization's total attention dedicated to &lt;em&gt;the same meeting every day&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What on earth are you doing in daily one hour meetings?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, we discuss the cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait, I thought the whole point of Jira was so that all your notes are on the electronic cards?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're asking too many questions, &lt;em&gt;heretic&lt;/em&gt;. Guards, seize them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, while this is usually enough to provoke complete confusion when explained to people with enough distance from the field to retain their grasp on common sense, it gets worse. Prepare yourself for a brain-frying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You typically don't just do work as it needs doing. In an effort to keep track of the team's commitments as time goes on, the team commits to &lt;em&gt;Sprints&lt;/em&gt;, which basically means that you commit about two weeks worth of cards to the board, then &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; work on those cards on pain of haranguing. Sprints are usually arranged back-to-back with no breaks, and "sprinting" nonstop throughout the year is obviously a totally healthy choice of words which has definitely never driven anyone to burnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to keep track of how much work is in each card, there is usually another meeting called Backlog Grooming, where the team sits around and estimates how much time each card is going to take. This is done by assigning Story Points to cards. What is a Story Point? Why, it's a number that is meant to represent &lt;em&gt;complexity&lt;/em&gt; rather than time, because we know in the software world that time estimates are notoriously unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make things even &lt;em&gt;simpler&lt;/em&gt;, most teams actually still use them to mean time, enough so that &lt;a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/dont-equate-story-points-to-hours"&gt;there are all sorts of articles&lt;/a&gt; out here where people desperately try to explain to professionals in the industry that they shouldn't use the phrase "Story Points" incorrectly, even though knowing what one of the core phrases in the methodology means &lt;em&gt;should be a given.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, you're with me so far, right? Scrum is a project management methodology based on Agile, where you run daily Stand-Ups to reflect on how your Sprint is going, and the progress of your Sprint is measured by the number of Story Points you've completed in your cards, which may or may not be hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuck, wait, did I say cards? There are no cards, there are Stories and Tasks, and a long sequence of Stories and Tasks contributes to an Epic... wait, did I not explain what an Epic is? An Epic usually translates to some broader commitment to the business. Sorry, sorry, we'll try again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you do the Stand-Ups to evaluate how many Story Points you've completed in your Sprint — ah shit, wait, wait, I forgot. Okay, so the number of Story Points you've done in a Sprint is Velocity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, right, so you want your Velocity to stay high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you run Backlog Grooming to produce Story Points for each of our Stories and Tasks, which are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; time estimates except when they are, and then we try to estimate how many Story Points we can fit into a Sprint, which is explicitly a timespan of two weeks, again keeping in mind that Story Points are &lt;em&gt;not time estimates&lt;/em&gt;, okay? If we do a good job, we'll have a high Velocity. And then we put that all into Jira, and you write down everything you're doing but then I also ask you about it every morning while I simultaneously try &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to turn this into a "justify your last eight hours of work" ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damn it, wait, wait, I forgot to tell you, these aren't meetings, okay? They're called Ceremonies, and the fact that I am demanding large swathes of people attend ceremonies against their will does not make this a cult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phew. Okay. Now, with all of that in mind, how many Story Points do you think it'll take you to update that API, Fred?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fred, you dumb motherfucker, Story Points have to adhere to the Fibonacci sequence&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, you stupid idiot. Four? You mud-soaked yokel. You've disrespected me, this team, and most of all, yourself. Christ, Fred, you're better than this. Fucking &lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt;? I wouldn't let that garbage-ass number near &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; business. I don't understand why you're struggling with th—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-none-of-these-words-are-in-the-bible"&gt;III. None Of These Words Are In The Bible&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone whose part of their job was to write end-user documentation at REDACTED about these exact things, you have my wholehearted, eye-twitching encouragement from this section alone.&lt;br&gt;
— A reader reluctantly working in Scrum advocacy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to stop there for a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may understand now why, when first confronted by Jira and the Agile Cult, I elected not to read anything about it for about a year. It was, after all, an organization-wide transformation being pushed by many people with big ol' beards and very serious names like Deloitte in their work histories. Repeated references were made to the Agile "manifesto" by non-engineers, which caused me to avoid reading anything about it. It was a whole &lt;em&gt;manifesto&lt;/em&gt;, for which the only frames of reference I have are voluminous works by Marx and Kaczynski which I haven't read either. Surely these people had been employed because they had some formidable skillset that I was missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine my befuddlement when I realized that this is the entirety of the manifesto:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals and interactions over processes and tools&lt;br&gt;
Working software over comprehensive documentation&lt;br&gt;
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation&lt;br&gt;
Responding to change over following a plan  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, while there is value in the items on the right,&lt;br&gt;
we value the items on the left more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You're all Agile certified! I'm so proud of all of us. This certificate is going right on the fridge, alongside the prettiest macaroni art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few things here are striking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is that I don't see any Proper Nouns at all. So all that Scrum-Velocity-Story-Point-Epic-Fibonacci stuff is very much some sort of philosophy emerging from a weird nerd-aligned religious schism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second thing is that the text is actually reasonable, and able to provoke meaningful discourse. For example, &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; individuals be contrasted with processes? Is taking the individual into account necessarily at odds with process? In some ways yes, in some ways no, but the authors are merely stating a rough preference for when the two come into conflict. And the final sentence walks back the preceding four, so this is hardly the incendiary foundation for the monolith of bullshit I just described.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where on earth is all this Scrum stuff coming from? There's nothing in the original manifesto that would suggest that this is sensible, nor is there anything that would even begin to send people down this strange pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the flaws with Scrum, you will find no support for this stark madness anywhere within an authoritative source on the topic. Yes, it comes with a thousand confusing names and questionable value, but it doesn't actually suggest people dedicate up to half their time to meetings. In fact, Scrum is mostly embraced in a manner which implies some of its most fervent advocates have failed to spend even a few minutes reading about their primary job functions. How else can we explain the prevalence of Story Points as time estimates, and the one hour meetings every morning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is exactly why I don't view Scrum itself as particularly problematic. The &lt;em&gt;fundamental issue&lt;/em&gt;, the one that is only moved by small degrees by project management methodologies, is that many, many people simply have totally unsophisticated ideas around how knowledge work functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv-anxiety-and-scrum-masters"&gt;IV. Anxiety&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  and Scrum Masters&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, someone was trying to bully me into estimating something. It took two hours of me saying "I can't estimate that, it has no end point, you don't understand what you're asking" for it to finally devolve into "Ok, you can't estimate it, I understand, but if you had to estimate it what would it be?"  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said fuck it, 8 hours for me to investigate and come back with an answer on how long the work would take... and they were happy with that. Nobody paused to consider it took 25% of my estimated time to have a meeting about why it was a dumb question.&lt;br&gt;
— A reader&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work at large companies has a tendency to blow up, run far behind schedule, then ultimately limp past the finish line in a maimed state. One of my friends talks about how, when faced by his first failed project on a team, a management consultant responded to all critical self-reflection with "But you'd say that, overall, this was a success?" in a desperate bid to generate a misleading quote to put into a presentation to the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core of this issue lies in the simple fact that time estimates will, with varying frequency based on domain and team skill, explode in &lt;em&gt;spectacular&lt;/em&gt; fashion. We are not even talking about a task taking twice as long as initially estimated. I'm talking about missing deadlines by &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt;. The software I mention in &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/flexible-schemas-are-the-mindkiller/"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; is now over ten years overdue. I am fairly certain that the majority of software projects collapse in this fashion, for reasons that would only fit into a post about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law"&gt;Sturgeon's Law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is in the shadow of this threat that the Scrum Master lives. Yes, that's right, there are still exciting Important Words that we haven't introduced. The Scrum Master, who I usually call Scrum Lords because it's funnier, is some sort of weird role that's specialized entirely in managing the Jira board, providing Agile coaching, and generally doing ad hoc work for an engineering team. Keeping with the theme of Scrum being bad but people being even worse at implementing it as prescribed, they usually end up being the project manager as well. Atlassian's definition of a Scrum Master notes that one of their core roles is "Remove blockers: superhero time", which makes me want to passionately make out with a double-barreled shotgun. I can only assume that Scrum Masters feel deeply infantilized by this, and I am offended on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="remove_blockers.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/b03ee9d3.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are generally very sad and stressed out, while simultaneously pissing off everyone around them. I can just punch any software YouTuber's name into the search bar along with "Scrum Master" and be assured that I can find someone &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBpK14MTW90"&gt;sneering&lt;/a&gt;. Putting that brief meanness aside, I am actually very sympathetic. They are, after all, people, and I take the bold stance that I'd prefer people be happy and self-actualized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this, with the boards and the Stories and the Epics, they're all mechanisms for trying to construct some terrible fractal of estimation that will mystically transmute the act of software engineering into the act of bricklaying. And I'm guessing that bricklaying is also way more complicated than it looks, so this still wouldn't improve matters much even if it worked. This is further complicated by the fact that most Scrum Masters have either no understanding of the work under consideration, or have learned enough merely to be dangerous&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This puts them into an impossible position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If companies are going to pay outsized compensation to perform a job that simply requires a degree and a willingness to endure tedium, I can hardly fault someone for taking that deal. Even the Atlassian definition of a Scrum Master notes that technical knowledge is &lt;a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/scrum-master"&gt;"not mandatory"&lt;/a&gt;, so who can blame them for not having technical knowledge? And once you're &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; that position, you have now become the shrieking avatar of the latent anxiety in the business. All projects are default dead barring exceptional talent, but this level of realism would fail to extract funding from the business, even if cool analysis reveals that the failure chance is still worth the risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Scrum Master is thus reduced to a tragic figure. They worry about losing their overpaid role, are not developing skills that are easily packaged when pitching themselves to other businesses, and feel responsible for far too much inside a project. Yet they do not have the knowledge or the power to debug the machine that is the team, even if they are well-intentioned and otherwise talented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad actors can more-or-less get away with saying anything to avoid doing work, because the truth is that only an engineer can tell when another engineer is making things up, which is precisely why we all live in fear of sketchy mechanics overcharging us for vehicle repairs. Even if someone is suspected as malingering, the Scrum Master is unable to initiate termination procedures, and will probably have to trust their gut to a degree that is unpalatable for most people if they want to escalate issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the project is running late, they have no recourse other than to ask the engineers to re-prioritize work, then perform what I think of as "slow failure", which is normally the demesne of the project manager. When a project is failing, the typical step is not to pull the plug or take drastic action, it is to gradually raise a series of delays while everyone pretends not to notice the broader trend. By &lt;em&gt;slowly&lt;/em&gt; failing, and at no point presenting anyone else in the business with a clear point where they should pull the plug, you can ultimately deliver nothing while tricking other people into implicitly accepting responsibility. The Scrum Master is generally not malicious, they are just failing to see the broader trend, and simply hoping for the sake of personal anxiety regulation that this task will indeed be accomplished by the next sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I run into someone in this position, I have very little trouble with my disdain when they're enjoying harassing everyone, but I mostly run into people who are actually struggling to be happy with 40 hours of their week. I know of Scrum Masters who have broken down crying when they hear that people are leaving teams — not due to a deep emotional connection with the person leaving, but because that anxiety is lying right below the surface, and almost any disruption can set it off. It is not unusual to hear people in this role flip between intensely rededicating themselves to "fixing the issues" and then despairing about their value to society, something that I personally went through on my first corporate team. It sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that the impact of the organization manifesting their anxiety in one person in this way, then giving that person control of meetings and the ability to deliver that anxiety to their teams, is perhaps one of the most counter-productive configurations possible if you assume that the median Scrum Master is not a bastion of self-regulation. These people exist, but I wouldn't bet on being able to hire a half dozen of them at an affordable rate. For most of us, including me, attaining this level of equanimity is very much a lifelong work-in-progress. But even this is not a problem with Scrum, it's a much more serious problem — that organizations run default-dead projects and have cultures where people have to hide this while executives loot the treasury — that is simply made &lt;em&gt;slightly worse&lt;/em&gt; by Scrum configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v-the-powerpoint-is-not-the-territory"&gt;V. The PowerPoint Is Not The Territory&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most engineers just go through the Scrum/Agile motions, finding clever ways to make that burndown chart progress at the right slant without questioning what they’re doing, and it’s nice to read someone articulating the negative thoughts that some of us have had for such a long time. Believe me when I say it’s been this way pretty much since the inception of this fad in the mid 90s.&lt;br&gt;
 — A reader&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have previously joked (I was actually dead serious) that the symbolic representation of the work, the card on the Jira board, is taken to be such a literal manifestation of the work that you can just move the pointless tasks to "Done" without actually doing anything and the business will largely not notice. If the card is in "Done", then the work is Done. The actual impact of the work is so low that no one notices, in a way that my electrician would never be able to get away with. Readers have written in to say that they have done exactly this, and nothing untoward has happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This conflation of management artefacts with the actual reality of the organization is widespread, and also not Scrum specific, but it is my contention that methodologies producing these artefacts is core to their appeal. A phrase I love is that "the map is not the territory", which more or less translates to the idea that &lt;em&gt;maps&lt;/em&gt; merely contain abstract symbols of the territory they represent, and that while we may never have access to a perfect view of the whole territory, it is important to understand that we aren't looking at the real territory. That little doodle of a mountain is not what the mountain actually looks like. Despite the scribble of a sleeping dragon, Smaugh may be awake when you get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The harsh truth is that, as with anything complicated enough in life, you cannot realistically de-risk it. We go through our days with complex five-year plans, have them utterly blown apart every year by Covid, assassinations, coups, and if you're super lucky the best you can hope for is the dreadful experience of watching &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; people getting cancer rather than yourself. Then, because this is terrifying, we immediately go back to pretending that the most important event in the next five years will also be predictable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; thing that we do because risk is usually terrifying (it's actually quite fun when you learn to expose yourself to &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; rare events —  say, writing in public), is we immediately cling to things that smooth this away. Software engineers do not like engaging with the business partially because they trend towards being nerds, but mostly because interfacing with true economic reality is confronting. And &lt;em&gt;non-programmers&lt;/em&gt; seem like they're interfacing with the reality of the business, but frequently they are interfacing with Reality As PowerPoint, which is closer to the territory but still &lt;em&gt;not the territory&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True reality is never accessible because no one has perfect information. We do not know whether our competitor's latest product is going to be far behind schedule or utterly obliterate us. We do not know if a pandemic is going to shut down the state for a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, reality that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; accessible is usually not accessible from a high vantage point. From a bird's eye view, you have no way of knowing that 80% of a specific team's output is from Sarah, and Sarah's son just broke his arm playing soccer so that project is about to collapse as she scrambles to cope. This is totally visible to &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; people at the business, but is not going to be shared with the person making promises to the board. We could build a complex systems-thinking approach about our work, but that is very hard and will have &lt;em&gt;obvious&lt;/em&gt; fuzziness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the mediocre executives I meet, particularly those I meet in the data governance space&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, love their PowerPoints and Jira boards because while they are nonsense, they are nonsense that looks non-fuzzy &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; you will only have to deal with their inaccuracy once every few years, at which point so many people signed off on the clear-but-wrong vision of reality that it's hard to tell who is ultimately accountable for the failure. A more effective management methodology, one which accurately portrays the degree to which no one knows what is going on because life is chaotic, only makes sense for an entirely privately owned business where the owner needs to &lt;em&gt;turn a profit&lt;/em&gt; rather than impress his employers or the markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mode of non-fuzzy being is only available to those who are salaried to "run the business", which means that they are not accountable to the territory, much like a hedge fund manager who receives bonuses for good years and a simple firing (keeping their ill-gotten gains) during a bad year, allowing them to engage in strategies that have &lt;em&gt;massively&lt;/em&gt; negative expected returns but only during rare events. This is in stark contrast to the reality of the bootstrapped business founder, such as the barber down the road, who will simply be on the hook for such losses. If you're looking for results, rather than being precise, we want the symbols for our work to look as fuzzy as we are uncertain, rather than pseudoclarity. I want the rope bridges on my map to exist in a superposition of being intact and destroyed in the last big storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is exactly what expensive PowerPoint reports and Jira provide. Pseudoclarity, for as long as you're willing to fork over enterprise license money. The version of reality where you can simply calculate how many Story Points you're completing per month, compare that to the number of Story Points in the project, then calculate that the project will be finished on time is very, very tempting, but the ability to do this is dictated by factors that are almost totally unrelated to Scrum itself. A team that can work this smoothly has probably already won, whatever you decide to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people have just lived with these symbols for so long that they think drawing a box on a PowerPoint slide that says "Secure Personally Identifiable Data" is the same thing as &lt;em&gt;actually making that happen&lt;/em&gt;, as if one could conjure a forest into existence by drawing some trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vi-dear-god-the-meetings"&gt;VI. Dear God, The Meetings&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny thing is that, every time my company tried to introduce OKRs and make it work, it was clear to me that nobody read the book nor understood the final goal. Like Agile or Scrum. People try to implement them as dogma, and they always backfire because of that. I guess it is always easier to be a cook and follow recipes than to be a chef and adjust based on current circumstances/ingredients.
— A reader&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is a specific problem with Scrum, something that I genuinely think makes it stand out as uniquely bad rather than just reflecting baseline organizational pathology, meetings are it. People are not good at running meetings, and mandating that they hold &lt;em&gt;more meetings&lt;/em&gt; does not merely reflect our weaknesses as a society, it greatly amplifies the consequences of that weakness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many meetings. So, so many meetings. Suffice it to say that anyone who runs a one-hour Stand-Up with any consistency should be immediately terminated if they are primarily Agile practitioners. There is very little to say here, save that people are so terrible at running meetings that, on average, the sanest thing to do for most businesses is pick a framework that minimizes the default number of them. I will appeal to authority here on the normalcy of meeting-running skill being low and simply quote Luke Kanies who has &lt;a href="https://lukekanies.com/writing/those-great-new-calendar-tools-probably-wont-help-you/"&gt;given meetings more thought than I have&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a manager’s day is built around meetings, and there is a new crop of tools to help with them. What’s not to love?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well. The tools are built by and for people who hate meetings, and often who aren’t very good at them. Instead, I want tools for people whose job is built around meetings, and who know they must be excellent at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of people who treat running meetings as seriously as we treat system design, &lt;em&gt;try not to run many meetings&lt;/em&gt;. If this sounds unpalatable then &lt;em&gt;get good, nerds&lt;/em&gt;. I'm turning the tattered remnants of my humility module off to say that the team at our consultancy runs a meeting at 8PM every Thursday, after most of the team has just worked their day job and struggled to send kids off to bed, and we actually look forward to it. This is attainable, though even then we constantly reflect on whether the meeting needs to keep existing before it wears out its welcome. I ask people very frequently, possibly too frequently, whether they're still having fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I currently believe that meeting-heavy methodologies are preferred because they feel like productivity if you aren't mindful enough to notice the difference between &lt;em&gt;Talking About Things&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Doing Things&lt;/em&gt;. Even some of the worst Agile consultants I know have periodically produced real output, but I suspect they can no longer differentiate between the things they do that have value and the things that do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vii-we-need-to-talk-about-jeff"&gt;VII. We Need To Talk About Jeff&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while ago, I wrote a short story about Scrum &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/praise-the-machine-spirit/"&gt;being a Lovecraftian plot designed to steal human souls&lt;/a&gt;. It ended with this quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, historians may look back on human progress and draw a sharp line designating "before Scrum" and "after Scrum." Scrum is that ground-breaking. [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've ever been startled by how fast the world is changing, Scrum is one of the reasons why. Productivity gains of as much as 1200% have been recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book you'll journey to Scrum's front lines where Jeff's system of deep accountability, team interaction, and constant iterative improvement is, among other feats, bringing the FBI into the 21st century, perfecting the design of an affordable 140 mile per hour/100 mile per gallon car, helping NPR report fast-moving action in the Middle East, changing the way pharmacists interact with patients, reducing poverty in the Third World, and even helping people plan their weddings and accomplish weekend chores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is so unhinged that readers thought this was something I made up. 1200% productivity improvements? You can use Scrum to report on wars &lt;em&gt;and accomplish your weekend chores&lt;/em&gt;? This looks like I asked ChatGPT to produce erotica for terminally online LinkedIn power users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the blurb from one of Jeff Sutherland's &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Scrum-Jeff-Sutherland/dp/038534645X"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Main Agile Guys. The subtitle of the book is "doing twice the work in half the time", so this absolute weirdo is proposing that Scrum makes you &lt;em&gt;four times faster than not doing Scrum&lt;/em&gt;. Jeff has also gone on record with amazing pearls of wisdom like &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jeffsutherland_agile-scrummaster-aichallenges-activity-7169779452820840448-D8FY?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Scrum team is ten times faster than a dysfunctional team and AI makes teams go four times faster, then when both use AI the Scrum team with still be be ten times faster than the dysfunctional AI team. Actually, what I am teaching today is not only for developers to use AI to generate 80% of the code and be five times faster. This will make each individual team member 5 times as productive and the whole team five times faster. But it you make the AI a developer on the team you will get a synergistic effect, potentially making the team 25 times faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff, what the &lt;em&gt;fuck&lt;/em&gt; are you saying? This is incomprehensible nonsense. You are throwing random numbers out &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/aDMjgOYOcDw?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=1568"&gt;faster than Ben Shapiro when he's flinging anti-trans rhetoric&lt;/a&gt;, a formidable accomplishment in and of itself, and they're all totally unsubstantiated. This is &lt;em&gt;insane&lt;/em&gt;. This is &lt;em&gt;demented&lt;/em&gt;. Scrum is ten times faster than a dysfunctional team? Are all non-Scrum teams dysfunctional? AI makes teams go four times faster? But you're teaching people to use AI to be &lt;em&gt;five&lt;/em&gt; times faster? Then if you put AI on the team as a developer there's a synergistic effect and they're 25 times faster? Fucking &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt;? What mystical AI do you have access to that can &lt;em&gt;replace a developer on a team today&lt;/em&gt; and why aren't you worth a trillion dollars?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if we throw Scrum into the mix for that sweet, sweet 10x speedup, can I get my team to be 250 times faster? Can our team of six people perform the work of, let me do some maths, &lt;em&gt;1500&lt;/em&gt; normal developers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How have we defaulted to a methodology that has this raving fanatic at the helm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="viii-cognitive-biases-and-doing-better"&gt;VIII. Cognitive Biases and Doing Better&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contracting has exposed me to a variety of technical challenges and domains, ranging from work I remember with fondness and pride, to the kinds of unbearable, interminable corporate Scrum nightmares you describe so eloquently in your blog which seemed to be cooked up in a lab intent on undermining and punishing any sign of genuine ambition towards the improvement of human life.&lt;br&gt;
— A reader&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that teams are messy, filled with emotion, and that this is further compounded by the fact that our work requires a great deal of emotional well-being to deliver consistently. I once worked on the management team at a Southeast Asian startup, and while I was terribly depressed at that job, I was able to get my work done with some degree of consistency. Now that I am in IT, I basically &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; program when I am in a negative headspace because I cannot think clearly, and this dominates most of the productivity gains I see in a typical engineering team. Poor sleep, low psychological safety, and a thousand other little levers in the brain can disrupt functioning. There is no real shortcut for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that said, I do have thoughts on how to do better, and you're going to get them no matter how annoying that is! Behold, the unbridled power of not relying on advertising revenue!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="names-matters-and-simple-is-good"&gt;Names Matters And Simple Is Good&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start very, very simply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Names matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agile is popular because the word Agile has connotations of speed, and that is genuinely as sophisticated as many people are when designing their entire company's culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprints are popular because the word Sprint has connotations of speed. The fact they are called Sprints has probably genuinely killed a few people when you aggregate the harm of being told you are Sprinting every week across a few million anxious people. Don't give things idiotic names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All methodologies should compete against a baseline of a bunch of sticky notes on a whiteboard, and you should question your soundness of mind every time you feel the need to introduce a Proper Noun, okay? Just have a big list of things to do, order in terms of what you want done first, and then do that. Just think about how much you'll save on onboarding and consultants for the exact same outcome in almost all cases. There are plenty of superior methods to this, but there are &lt;em&gt;way more&lt;/em&gt; worse ones. If you have a meeting, just call it a meeting and prepare an agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I swear to God, if you invent a Proper Noun and someone asks me to learn it for no reason, sweet merciful Jesus, I will find you and  —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cognitive-biases"&gt;Cognitive Biases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spectacular amount of the design that goes into these methodologies is based around avoiding cognitive biases around estimation, though they frequently fall short because there is no easy fix for a mind that craves only easy fixes. That one sentence describes 90% of dysfunction in all fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the Fibonacci sequence restrictions, meaning that four Story Points can't exist (which is hilarious when adopted by teams using Story Points as time, because now four days can't exist). The generous reasoning behind this is that the variance in a highly-complex or time-intensive task is higher than that of a simple task, so it makes sense to force people into increasingly large number rather than stressing about a single point here or there. In reality, this is fucking silly and if someone suggested this &lt;em&gt;ex nihilo&lt;/em&gt;, without the background of Scrum, we'd be absolutely baffled. But hey, an attempt was made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the suggestions will be around different models for handling these biases. I'll indicate which of these I have actually tried. For the most part, I have found that the typical organization is completely unwilling to actually try these, and will only consider them when talking to me when I am presenting in my Consultant Mode, not my Employee Mode. Even though I am more deeply embedded in the workplace culture as an employee, most people can't stop seeing ICs as too low-status to take seriously. In these contexts, I've just gone rogue and experimented without management buy-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bets-and-sunk-costs"&gt;Bets and Sunk Costs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basecamp has a free book out online that talks about a methodology they call ShapeUp. It's quite good despite my general disdain for business books. In it, they explicitly deal with the failure mode of tasks stretching well beyond their value to the business, existing in the perpetual zone of "almost done".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We combine this uninterrupted time with a tough but extremely powerful policy. Teams have to ship the work within the amount of time that we bet. If they don’t finish, by default the project doesn’t get an extension. We intentionally create a risk that the project—as pitched—won’t happen. This sounds severe but it’s extremely helpful for everyone involved.&lt;br&gt;
First, it eliminates the risk of runaway projects. We defined our appetite at the start when the project was shaped and pitched. If the project was only worth six weeks, it would be foolish to spend two, three or ten times that.&lt;br&gt;
[...]&lt;br&gt;
Second, if a project doesn’t finish in the six weeks, it means we did something wrong in the shaping. Instead of investing more time in a bad approach, the circuit breaker pushes us to reframe the problem. We can use the shaping track on the next six weeks to come up with a new or better solution that avoids whatever rabbit hole we fell into on the first try. Then we’ll review the new pitch at the betting table to see if it really changes our odds of success before dedicating another six weeks to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this does is turn off the sunk cost fallacy, forcibly. It's very smart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran this for a while with the other engineer mentioned in &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/flexible-schemas-are-the-mindkiller/"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the broad horror of that story, it was the most productive work period of my life. It's also worth noting that the other engineer went on to become one of my co-founders, and that we both studied psychology together before getting into IT. A lot of our effectiveness came down to ruthless self-analysis and paying attention to failure modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="small-slippages-dont-exist"&gt;Small Slippages Don't Exist&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the advice given by P. Fagg, an experienced hardware engineer, "Take no small slips." That is, allow enough time in the new schedule to ensure that the work can be carefully and thoroughly done, and that rescheduling will not have to be done again.
 —  Fred Brooks, &lt;em&gt;The Mythical Man Month&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the smartest and most practicable thing that I'm ever going to write on this blog. Unsubscribe after this because it's all downhill from here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a rather strange phenomenon that arises around project lateness. When we estimate that something is going to be completed in a month, the natural temptation is to think that, when you are one day overdue, that you are &lt;em&gt;almost done&lt;/em&gt;. I.e, it will be finished in one month and five days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, each day past the deadline &lt;em&gt;increases&lt;/em&gt; the estimated deadline. Prepare yourself for one of my patented doodles, a thing which I am bullied for relentlessly at work, and enjoy the dreadful simulated experience of being one of my colleagues enduring an interminable lecture about some abstract concept that no one cares about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A small chart showing a project that will probably finish between one and two months" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/d2fbc18c.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the distribution that people think that are sampling from. As you move past the one month mark, you are approaching the sad probability that it'll take two months, but the likelihood of that is astonishingly low. At each point, the odds are that it's the &lt;em&gt;next sprint&lt;/em&gt; where you'll deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is that if you keep missing deadlines (or even miss one deadline), reality is gently, and eventually not-so-gently, informing you that you are &lt;em&gt;not drawing from the distribution you thought you were&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, which each passing day, it is increasingly likely that you are drawing from some super cursed distribution that will ruin your project forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A chart showing two estimates one for the same project, one lasting two months at most, and the other taking over 18 months" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/9ac328af.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each delay represents the accumulation of evidence that you are more likely to be drawing from the blue instead of the red, or something &lt;em&gt;even worse than the blue&lt;/em&gt;. These days, when something important is late by &lt;em&gt;one day&lt;/em&gt;, I immediately escalate to the highest alert level possible. This is unpalatable for political reasons, but it is the only appropriate response. It works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've tried this out, and I have never regretted it. I also once warned an executive about a server that was two weeks late in being provisioned. I failed to adequately explain the idea because it was complicated, they were impatient, and I hadn't practiced the explanation enough times... and I think that it's too counter-intuitive for non-statisticians to actually act on. Doing unusual things is a genuinely hard skill, even if you absolutely believe that the unusual thing is better. That server was provisioned a year behind schedule. There are no small delays in my world, only early delivery and absolute catastrophes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="no-deadlines"&gt;No Deadlines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our consultancy doesn't do deadlines. This was a strange idea when I first came across it because it is so different from the corporate norm, but it's a much better model when you have trust with the parties involved. If you don't have trust, guess what, nothing else matters. We pair this with fixed price billing, but the core is that we try to only work projects where there's no real risk of a few weeks here or there affecting our client adversely. The fixed price billing means that we aren't rewarded for running late, and have a higher effective hourly rate if we deliver something the client is happy with in less time. It also means that clients don't feel bad when we do things like document comprehensively or improve test suites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is tricky, because it runs totally counter to how a large business operates, but there would also be very little to enjoy in starting a business only to do what everyone else is doing. There's common wisdom in the savvier parts of the IT world that you should limit the number of weird things you do with regards to technology stack. Even that is actually an argument against bias (people drastically underestimate the difficulties of using weird technology and overestimate the value) — but that's also terrible advice if you actually know what you're doing. You want to maximize the amount of weird stuff you're doing across the business to generate asymmetry with your competitors, with the admittedly serious caveat that the pathway to this particular ancient ruin is littered with skulls. Pay attention to the skulls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't very useful for a larger business, as usually they have been architected to rely on conventional mechanisms, but it's worth thinking about the fact that this is possible. Authors like &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanstark/"&gt;Jonathan Stark&lt;/a&gt; have it as part of their normal practice. You can choose to build a system that is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; predicated on this idea of work flowing linearly through a system like a factory floor. In fact, one of the most famous books on IT operations is &lt;em&gt;The Phoenix Project&lt;/em&gt;, but the &lt;em&gt;The Phoenix Project&lt;/em&gt; is self-admittedly just a reskinned version of &lt;em&gt;The Goal&lt;/em&gt;, a totally different book that is &lt;em&gt;explicitly about factory floors&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also totally beside the point, but the audiobook version of &lt;em&gt;The Goal&lt;/em&gt; has a romantic subplot &lt;em&gt;in a book about factory operations&lt;/em&gt; and the editors included smooth saxophone when the protagonist finally frees up enough time at work to attend to his ailing marriage, which caused me to exhale tea through my nose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, here is a boring disclaimer that some industries simply can't get away with experimenting along these dimensions. Microchip manufacturers need to deliver the product in time for the next iPhone to ship or Apple cancels the contract. C’est la vie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="estimation-is-expensive"&gt;Estimation Is Expensive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a point taken from a private conversation with &lt;a href="https://nonlinear.garden/"&gt;Jesse Alford&lt;/a&gt;, but obviously tasks &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be estimated accurately, it's just expensive. I've done it before to a higher accuracy than I've seen on any Scrum team, with minimal practice, just by taking the time to have deep conversations with another engineer about the work. Unfortunately, it takes a non-trivial amount of engineering effort to do, and frequently has to be paired with actual work. Once again going to Basecamp, whose kool-aid I swear that I only drink sparingly even though it's delicious and refreshing, they have a specific chart on their platform called a hill chart. I love hill charts. They look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A chart of a hill-shaped diagram, with tasks on the left climbing towards the middle, and tasks on the right sliding down the hill" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/87e04d9e.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, they reflect the reality that there is a phase of a project where scope &lt;em&gt;increases&lt;/em&gt; as you run into new cases during implementation, and then a phase where you actually have a good idea of how long something is going to take. For example, if I was going to integrate an application with a third-party application, the period of horror where I learn about the Informatica API (a wretched abomination whose developers should be crucified) is the left side of the chart as I learn things like "The security logs &lt;a href="https://docs.informatica.com/cloud-common-services/administrator/current-version/rest-api-reference/platform-rest-api-version-3-resources/security-logs.html"&gt;don't tell you if a login attempt was successful&lt;/a&gt;, just that someone clicked the login button". The right side of the chart, once I have painfully hiked up the hillside which is littered in caltrops, is where I say "This is still absolute torment, but I am now confident that there are only three days of pain left".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can have their gigantic Jira board, I guess, if they're willing to put that much time into something that isn't the work itself. And of course, that wouldn't be that great anyway, as it's possible to miss board deadlines, have to perform re-work, otherwise teams you depend on could screw up, people leave the team or become demotivated, etc. For the most part, businesses are best served by doing really, really simple things that have outsized value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even within the consultancy, the only things we've bothered setting internal deadlines for are those that we've been procrastinating on. Even our deadlines are deployed towards psychological ends. This will change over time, but it has been totally fine until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="autonomy-builds-morale"&gt;Autonomy Builds Morale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing crushes software engineering productivity faster than low morale. Generally speaking, software engineers in the first world are well-paid enough, and their work is hard enough to measure, that you cannot intimidate them into working faster by standing behind them whilst demanding they flip burgers faster. Nor would I want to, on account of at least trying not to be a bastard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scrum teams, and &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; team that does not pay extremely close attention to the symbolic framework that the team is operating in, will collapse over the course of approximately a year. A core issue with Scrum specifically is that many of the ceremonies symbolize extant organizational issues &lt;em&gt;much too clearly&lt;/em&gt;. One of the other important meetings, the Retrospective (I know, there's another word!) is where you sit down and evaluate how a sprint went, and what the team can change. I love the idea of the Retrospective. It is a fantastic idea that any team aspiring to greatness should adopt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if everyone in the Retrospective requires organizational permission to change things, or is the generic team where changes are not addressed with violent purpose, the Retrospective becomes emblematic of everything that makes people feel disrespected. On my current conventional-employment team, only about 20% of the team continues to attend Retrospectives, which is the outcome I've gradually observed everywhere I've seen Scrum. Again, this isn't a problem with Scrum — it's that Retrospectives interact positively with good cultures and negatively with bad cultures, and since most cultures are bad, it follows that Scrum is actively harmful to deploy into a random environment. It's only appropriate to roll it out when the organization is ready to &lt;em&gt;actually make changes&lt;/em&gt;, and the continuance of the process should be immediately interrogated, and possibly terminated, the moment an engineer reports that they feel it's a waste of time. You can bring it back &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; figuring out how it all went so wrong the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ix-scrumbled-eggs-all-over-my-face"&gt;IX. Scrumbled Eggs All Over My Face&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's probably some broad lesson in here about thoughtfulness, constantly evolving how you approach your craft and the structures that surround it, being suspicious of people selling 1200% improvements in productivity, and accepting that there's no substitute for reading and thinking deeply about your problems. There is no management methodology that will make up for having team members that proselytize full-time for a philosophy that is five lines long &lt;em&gt;without having read those five lines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that sounds really tiring! Someone has announced &lt;a href="https://agile2.net/"&gt;Agile 2.0&lt;/a&gt;, baby! Nothing can go wrong! Finally, all our problems are solved! Goodnight, everybody!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;

&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This frequently boils down to professional responsibility cosplayers hoping that by repeating the phrase "break down silos" every day, they will be able to network every employee at the company into one gigantic Borg cube, somehow achieving all the upsides of specialization and none of the downsides. There is a nuanced middle-ground between these two points, and 90% of people are accordingly busy not acknowledging this.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to look this up despite seeing it in practice many times because it's so weird that I felt like I was just making things up.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/business#etymonline_v_18132"&gt;The etymology of the word business&lt;/a&gt; reveals that it originally stemmed from something approximately meaning "anxiety". It is claimed that this sense of the word is now obsolete... but I think you and I both know that there's a sliver of it still in there.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a sexy phrase in business and software because people like the idea of being "dangerous" when they are in fact being extremely boring. News flash: things being dangerous is &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;, you mad bastards. Programming is not skydiving and that is okay. Learn enough to be safe instead. Imagine learning enough surgery or cybersecurity to be &lt;em&gt;dangerous&lt;/em&gt; then bragging about it. Even Michael Hartl's &lt;em&gt;Learn Enough To Be Dangerous&lt;/em&gt; courses actually make you exceedingly safe.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where grifters are flocking to in my field, because it sounds responsible and the industry has decided it doesn't require technical ability. I attended a meeting a few weeks ago where someone had written a slide saying that "robotics" are part of our five-year plan. My brother in Christ, I'm a glorified database administrator, why do I need &lt;em&gt;robots&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:6"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wildest thing about all this is that I actually &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; the manifesto and I still think most of this is bullshit. I like the principles enough that our consultancy is current leaning heavily towards adopting Extreme Programming practices.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:6" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave you the chance of aiding me willingly, but you have elected the way of pain!&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every few weeks, I receive an email or have a conversation that makes me reflect on whether I'm living up to my own ideals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emails talk about how refreshing it is to see someone saying what most people are thinking, and how it must be brave to put my thoughts out there. The conversations are about how you don't really have principles unless you're sometimes suffering for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I'm not really doing any of that. I've been working three days a week for almost two years now, and it has been as comfortable as is possible to imagine. I have enough money to spend on whatever I want, I have time off, and even when I'm working the workload is almost non-existent. It is, for most people, a dream job. And it only comes at the low, low cost of my integrity!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each day I go to the office, and I watch people senselessly babble about AI and robotics while what we actually do is maintain a pile of teetering spreadsheets and schemaless metadata&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In the past year I've had one conversation with our executive and one conversation with &lt;a href="https://lukekanies.com/"&gt;Luke Kanies&lt;/a&gt;, and all I can say is that our executive did not come off favorably. I see management contort themselves into horrible pain-pretzels, wondering why being more &lt;em&gt;Agile&lt;/em&gt; isn't getting them the outcomes they want. Some have asked me if I can find them work elsewhere, because they are dimly aware that I am weirdly well-connected for a lowly IC. I want to shake them and say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen! Listen! You're a great person! You're smart! You need to snap yourself out of this. My third eye has penetrated the veil of the future, and I see a thousand years of suffering rolling out before you! An endless purgatory where each step towards salvation requires an hour of backlog grooming! A lifetime of shoving cards around a Jira board and reading Gartner reports as the spark of intelligence is snuffed from your mind! Your sight will dim, and your visage will darken, and still you will lay upon your death bed thinking that you may fend off the Reaper if you could but Estimate how long dying will take!&lt;br&gt;
...&lt;br&gt;
And I won't get you a job unless you &lt;em&gt;read a fucking book&lt;/em&gt;, okay?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what I say instead is "I'm sure that you'll find a better job eventually. Okay, clocking out for the week, bye." How lightly I withhold the opportunity for self-improvement, because I know that they will take the news badly, and because I do not believe that they have what it takes to change. It's not that it's my job to be responsible for all that, but withholding that information from people that &lt;em&gt;think of me as being honest with them&lt;/em&gt; goes against my own values. And what standard is there to hold myself to if not my own?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of January 2025, I'll be leaving my employer to focus full-time on my own business. It doesn't currently make enough money to pay my rent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two helpings of suffering with a side of principles, please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i-appearances"&gt;I. Appearances&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, fuck your gold&lt;br&gt;
You should take it all and melt it&lt;br&gt;
Make a bullet, kill yourself quick&lt;br&gt;
Yeah, put that money where your mouth is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea how this happened, but I am now in a position where students reach out to me and ask for career advice. One sent me an email &lt;em&gt;while I was writing this&lt;/em&gt;. A cursory glance over my career would reveal that while I'm better at my job than one would expect given that I have usually been the sole person that doesn't panic during a merge conflict, there are &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; people who are better than me. I suppose it's mostly a function of my writing skill outpacing my programming skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As time has gone by, I've had to think about what I can offer those students, and the more experienced readers too. It isn't engineering guidance — I have some small war stories about simplicity and social dynamics, but there are people more qualified on both topics&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Usually, I conclude that it's trying to demonstrate conviction and bravery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, there's nothing particularly brave about essentially snidely sub-Tweeting people embarrassing themselves in meetings, right? It's braver than &lt;em&gt;not saying anything at all, anywhere&lt;/em&gt;, but the reason that I get away with it is that as long as my writing is &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;, the people who are wasting millions of dollars in taxpayer money or bullying staff can get away with it. I exist in two realities, and can get away with pseudo-bravery as long as it doesn't actually inconvenience anyone in power, then get points in the public eye for the non-risk. At what point does a person say "I'd rather risk going hungry than degrade myself like this"? A few months ago, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidkellam/?originalSubdomain=au"&gt;David Kellam&lt;/a&gt; told me that you've only got principles if you suffer for them sometimes, and a local CTO named &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alanperkins/"&gt;Alan Perkins&lt;/a&gt; regaled me with a story of walking out into the worst job market of his life after being told to do something illegal. At what point do funny blog rants go from just that, some funny posts, to someone complaining about a self-inflicted situation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My greatest personal hero, despite being actively disliked by a great number of people who mostly miss the point, is Nassim Taleb. The central theme running through his model of ethics in the modern world is "skin in the game", and the height of cowardice is risk transference. And of course, that's what it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; for me to work my current job. I have taken all the risk out of starting my business, and my writing, and essentially my life. My risks are roughly whatever the probability of heart disease is in my age category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Taleb's world, risk-taking is bravery, and it's as simple as that. Success is nice, but not virtuous in and of itself. Winning is good, and don't get me wrong, victory is glorious and to be sought with every fiber of your being. If you are very clever, you can win without risk-taking, and that's still good, but &lt;em&gt;that isn't the thing I can model for the world&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next time that someone says I've "spoken truth to power", I hope that I'll be able to look at my tower of responsibilities and the empty pits that used to contain my savings and think "I earned it this time".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-living-in-reality"&gt;II. Living In Reality&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large organizations will, as a rough rule, try to treat you with as much indignity as they can get away with. It starts the very second that the recruiter asks &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; how much you want from the role, in the hopes that you say a number that's way too low, and continues for as long as you don't know how to handle yourself. Most people don't know how to handle themselves &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;, and are at the mercy of whether their particular manager cares about human decency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, an inability to treat yourself with respect is something that our system selects for in many places. There &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; things that doing a bunch of Leetcode exercises checks for that are correlated with job performance, though I can think of much better interview processes for most roles. But a side effect is that it's &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; a check for how much indignity you'll tolerate — we all hate them &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; when they're done badly, but terrible organizations have reached a stable equilibrium where the willingness to tolerate bullshit is a prerequisite for joining. That is &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; the worst places have the rudest interviewers. Just do this take-home interview, unpaid, over the weekend, what's the problem? You don't &lt;em&gt;value your time&lt;/em&gt;, do you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most organizations&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; even require the suppression of any internal reality that conflicts with the organization's reality. Iris Meredith&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; once noted that it's interesting how what is "real" in an organization depends entirely on what management says is real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if a &lt;em&gt;project manager&lt;/em&gt; says that a project is behind schedule, then the PowerPoint now has a red circle on it. Full stop. Battle stations. If a software engineer says that a critical activity is blocked, even if that engineer is the most qualified person to know how blocked the project is, it is usually the case that the project only adopts red circle status if the project manager agrees. You can even violate the chain of command and jump above the project manager, and that might work, but your CEO will usually &lt;em&gt;still check with the project manager first&lt;/em&gt;. And none of this is even malice — in the scenario above, everyone is agreeing with the engineer and actually behaving quite reasonably, but they can't do it unless the right people have certified that this is the new reality. Even at a &lt;em&gt;decent&lt;/em&gt; company it is overwhelmingly likely that you have to subsume your own perceived reality in favor of the organization's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the realm that many executives live in, sadly. They've spent so many years looking at things from a "bird's eye view" that they have utterly conflated the symbolic representations of the organization with the organization itself. One of the up-and-coming areas in the data world is Data Governance. It's a serious discipline, but most practitioners seem to live in some strange world where they simply draw squares on a chart and think that this makes the world so — as if they can program the organization with abstractions on a simulated acetate slide. I have seen people write the phrase "personally identifiable information tagging" on a report then wait six months for a committee to decide that this has been done, when all that has been accomplished is an incomplete spreadsheet. Thus has my will been manifested! Tremble, ye mighty, and despair! It is some sort of psychodynamic process that I have trouble unpacking, but it boils down to a psychological distance from the fact that true reality exists, and that someone lower status has to handle it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why, two weeks ago, I attended a three hour meeting where, and this is true, someone had drawn over a hundred boxes that just listed technical capability the business should have over the next five years. These boxes included "Robotics", "Web Server", "Firewall", and "Fuzzy Logic". When I asked why, one person very sincerely told me that this was the future of the organization, and &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; told me that it was just to impress executives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exhausting. I have a brain and thoughts and insights. I want to live in a world where my actions matter and everything isn't just PowerPoint nonsense. I work on a product that loses money every year, but internally we just totally fabricate time savings for internal staff, estimate their hourly rate, then say that was our saving. &lt;em&gt;The more we overpay people, the more we say we're saving&lt;/em&gt;. This is fucking &lt;em&gt;madness&lt;/em&gt;, and I pretend it isn't because I've been bought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may immediately want to leave the real world because it'll turn out that earning a living is extremely hard and our economy is mostly fraudulent, but then I'll at least go back to an office &lt;em&gt;happily&lt;/em&gt; then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-self-respect"&gt;III. Self-Respect&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been talking to my partner about having children one day. I don't know what the plan is now — children are certainly too expensive for me right now on part-time hours, let alone on a yet-to-be-validated business. But I do know that I would tell my child to stand up for themselves, and I can't do that in good conscience if I don't do it myself. And I can't honestly say I've &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; done that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's an episode of Radio Free XP, titled &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/radio-free-xp/id1707924562"&gt;"The Difference between Kind and Nice"&lt;/a&gt; where guest Elisabeth Hendrickson, who is awesome, says the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He got upset about the way that things were going, and he was a little bit of a table pounder. [...] This was a learning moment for me, because I remember not just walking out and saying "Okay, I resign". If I reported to someone who was doing that today, my resignation effective immediately would be on their desk. There is no second chance, there is no discussion about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing the tape forward, I want to tell a future kid that I'm like Elisabeth, and I want to believe it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I had taken about four hours out of my day to write the organization's first development container. This is basically just a pre-packaged Docker image which contains everything someone needs to work in our main technology stack, and it represented a huge step forward for the company. It'd get shipped out to dozens of engineers, and resolve all issues with passwords not being kept in password managers &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; debugging environmental mismatches would be trivial forevermore. I was in the late stages of this when a project manager walked up to me and told me to stop working on it because... well, just because, okay? You can't improve anything unless it's on the Jira board, because there is no room for judgement, your mood, or anything other than the almighty board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was livid, but only for a few seconds. I defused the situation with the normal corporate move — I said something vaguely affirming about their great judgement and waited for 5PM. I didn't think too much of this, until Jesse Alford described it as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve told me stories that are basically equivalent to “I was working on this until someone walked right over and slapped it out of my hand, then made me thank them for the assistance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's basically what happened. I was sitting there, then someone slapped my work out of my hand and wouldn't go away until their ego was assuaged. I don't think they're even aware that this is their relationship with their peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was very painful to hear summarized so succinctly. So much for the "I Will Fucking Dropkick You" image, right? It turns out that, when push comes to shove, I'd let someone bowl me over like a kid in a sandbox because I know that they'd want to have a two hour discussion about it that goes in circles until I have no energy. That's just bullying via a lack of social awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friends often tell me, after working massive shifts, that management would &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; to give them a raise but there's no budget. Spoiler alert: Budgets are just money being allocated to different things, and unless the company can't make payroll as-is, "no budget" means "we think something else is more important". That isn't even an unfair thing — not everyone can be the most important issue at all times, but phrasing it as "no budget" requires inferential steps for the employee to figure out that they're not valued as much as they thought they were. What is &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; being said at an organization large enough for these matters to be impersonal is "we think you'll stay, or that you leaving isn't worth the extra money".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was the time that I &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-accidentally-saved-half-a-million-dollars/"&gt;generated A$500K in cloud savings&lt;/a&gt; then received a &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/tech-management-has-bestowed-glory-upon-me/"&gt;A$60 gift voucher&lt;/a&gt; despite &lt;em&gt;explicitly&lt;/em&gt; asking for a raise. A promotion was later handed out to someone that once asked me what Python is. &lt;em&gt;We're a Python shop&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those should have been my "resignation on the table, goodbye" moments, but I sucked it up for the money. I have to model better behavior than that. That's over, it's done, I have fully become my blog persona. My child shall be like unto a great hurricane that has come to sweep the world aside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv-sweet-sweet-vengeance"&gt;IV. Sweet, Sweet Vengeance&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is straightforward. I'm absolutely done watching Deloitte and their foul ilk trick people into buying junior engineers at A$2K per day to do serverless-everything for no reason. The only thing that registers with such organizations is being knifed in the wallet, where it hurts. I'm never going to be able to do that as an employee. Well, it turns out that I can reliably send my thoughts into the international IT zeitgeist, so the next natural step is to build a business into a platform where I can try to make buying MongoDB for no reason embarrassing for the right people. The scale of my disruptive ambition has gone up. At least one bad actor in my local market is about to catch a financial blade to the gut, and my company will drink their blood for blessed nourishment, then we will use that nourishment to signal to everyone else that KPMG is so bad at programming that you can eat their lunch 24/7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v-beliefs-and-responsibility"&gt;V. Beliefs and Responsibility&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are never dedicated to something you have complete confidence in. No one is fanatically shouting that the sun is going to rise tomorrow. They know it's going to rise tomorrow. When people are fanatically dedicated to political or religious faiths or any other kinds of dogmas or goals, it's always because these dogmas or goals are in doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have strong beliefs about work: what it can be, what it shouldn't be, and what it takes away from people when done thoughtlessly. The sheer &lt;em&gt;strength&lt;/em&gt; of those beliefs, in the sense that they generate force and move people, is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; from my certainty. It's very much the opposite. It's because I feel that they &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be true deep in my heart, but that in reality I am terrified that they are not.  The distance between those two things generates incredible pressure to demonstrate to my own satisfaction, and the world writ large, that my quiet suspicions are not wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich Hickey has a lovely talk titled &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc"&gt;Hammock Driven Development&lt;/a&gt;. It talks a lot about how your best work is done when you have freedom to think clearly on a topic, which sometimes means hours free to lie in a hammock and process the five hours of study you just did. To me, this is the epitome of what knowledge work can be. Not because lying in a hammock is restful and I am lazy, but because having the &lt;em&gt;space&lt;/em&gt; to think is wonderful for everyone. It deepens your thinking and is how you produce true craftspeople — and note that the downtime comes &lt;em&gt;secondary&lt;/em&gt; to a period of hard work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments on his talk largely agree, but also come in the following flavours:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminds me of how I solved some of the hardest problems I've ever worked on (all in side projects) while being on parental leave, pushing around strollers. During that time I had something of 1-2 hours at the keyboard each day, but endless hours to think. It was quite the enlightening experience, I was literally shocked how much I got done as opposed to exploring problems while writing code.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29413382"&gt;But I've never managed to find that kind of focus at work, neither as developer nor CTO, neither remote nor on site. I feel I've always spent a large chunk of my time trying to get people to explain the problem they're trying to solve, to stop rushing, or to reduce scope. Tragic, really.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working for someone else makes it hard to do this often: there are processes in place to avoid developers doing anything other than finishing the ticket (for example timing the ticket and checking they did exactly what it said within the last estimate).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29412896"&gt;Which is fine with me because I can save deep thinking for side projects.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frantic political rush at large companies bothers me to no end. I believe, on more-or-less total faith, that it is possible to run a business such that work is done in a sustainable fashion. I know many CEOs with sports cars, which means there is surplus that is being generated. With the right marketing and careful project selection, I think there's enough low-hanging fruit in consulting work that a well-oiled team can generate enough money to pay six people extremely well, to do thoughtful work, and to even impart some of that culture onto the organizations that work with us. I don't see any reason why, with sufficient care and discipline, we can't get a business running where a member of the team can say they want three months off, fully paid, to spend time with their children, and the rest of us can't say "Hey, that's great, I guess we're testing our &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor"&gt;bus factor&lt;/a&gt; for a bit. Have fun!" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time, I poked around the job market looking for a company that operated this way. I think they do exist, but that they largely don't need to hire. Would you ever leave such a place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all personal preference. I've realized that I have, sadly, picked up values that have interacted with my life experiences in such a way that employment at anywhere but the greatest workplaces is unpalatable, and no one is entitled to the fruits of someone else's labor like that. If someone has done the hard work to create a sensible, efficient workplace, why would they just start hiring people &lt;em&gt;when the whole point of efficiency is that they don't need to?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And really it's an abdication of responsibility, right? I want better working conditions than those offered at nearly any company for myself and my friends, and instead of trying to manifest it myself like an adult, I was sitting around hoping that someone else had done the hard part for me, and pretty please would they let me into their cool club and give me six figures of income? With sprinkles on top? That's not how you get anything that you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vi-community"&gt;VI. Community&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reader I was trying to find work for officially became homeless a few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, I know, I can't solve all the problems in the world. I don't earn my living through this blog and this isn't my job. I wasn't trying to solve the world's problems, I was trying to solve one problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I've looked for work seriously for three people. One of them hasn't found a job in a few months. One is now homeless. One did find a job through me. Except I didn't &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; do the hard part. Reader &lt;a href="https://coreysnipes.com/"&gt;Corey Snipes&lt;/a&gt; hired my friend Ed Kachelries, a Viking-looking guy with no degree, a cheap laptop I shipped him from Australia because he couldn't afford one, and a link to &lt;em&gt;Automate The Boring Stuff&lt;/em&gt;. Corey hired him out of pocket for a few hours per week to get him early experience, but I think it actually ended up being the best hourly rate Ed had ever had because America is an accursed hellscape if you aren't rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When our friends and family lose their jobs, as an employee, you're usually reduced to scrabbling in the dirt. You check if your company is hiring, but they usually aren't. You ask around, but the whole market tends to go down at the same time because the industry tends to all invest in the same stupid things at the same time. If someone &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; hiring, they're usually not going to allow you to directly intervene in the process, because they're worried you're going to bias the process&lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; with irrelevant information like years of friendship and a knowledge of their character. You just don't have the resources to &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; care for people who have invoked the ire of the CFO because they had the wrong job title during the peak of the Covid pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to put the work in so that the next time I can't help someone, at least I tried something that wasn't begging someone else to do the hard part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vii-confidence-arrogance"&gt;VII. Confidence | Arrogance&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the hardest part of all this is that starting a business &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; saying that you can do better. Doing it is boastful. You're saying "the odds don't apply to me". When you have any problem with how businesses run, there's always &lt;em&gt;some nerd&lt;/em&gt; that snidely chimes in with "Well, why don't you start a business if it's so easy?" because they're betting on you being as cowardly&lt;sup id="fnref:7"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; as them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I would encourage web developers to share stories of all the terrible apps they've been asked to work on because someone else had an idea, but the idea-haver is willing to share revenue if you do all the work. The poor numbers on starting businesses must be heavily influenced by the fact that people who start businesses tend to be doing it for reasons of personality defect. Just talk to people about what the executives are like at the typical startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, it is terribly boring to live life in maximally humble fashion. It's fine to say you're going to do something then totally screw it up. Just do it with your own money and reputation. I've worked with so many brilliant people stuck in mediocre work situations, and when I ask them why they stay, they all have excuses that boil down to "I don't think I'm good enough". Then they go to therapy and never realize that self-esteem is built by a mixture of addressing negative self-talk &lt;em&gt;and doing hard things&lt;/em&gt;, which is incidentally also how you build team morale. You can't &lt;em&gt;talk&lt;/em&gt; yourself out of feeling like you never accomplish anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I tell my friends before they try something that they're worried is overly ambitious is that you're only arrogant &lt;em&gt;if you're wrong&lt;/em&gt;. I actually do have a lot of self-belief &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/on-burnout-mental-health-and-not-being-okay/"&gt;born of surviving terrible depression&lt;/a&gt;. Whatever I do will be easier than that, and the worst I am actually risking is having to come back here at the end of 2025, hat in my hands, to say that I've gone back to an office job having done A$0 revenue. I also have real, solid confidence in my team — which is weird to say, because it's a statement that I'm used to executives spouting off with for people that they talk to for ten minutes a year. But they volunteer their weekday evenings with me. They picked up the phone and drove hours to get coffee with me when I was sick. I've worked with all of them before, and I believe the only thing that's stopping us from doing more business is that we don't have anyone working sales full-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a rough rule, I wish that LinkedIn CEOs experienced a lot more self-doubt and that software engineers that bother to engage with the humanities had a lot more confidence. That's the only reason the former group runs things — the lack of thoughtfulness has made them blissfully unaware of how wide the skill spectrum can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't come across that many people in my life that have &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; bet on themselves with real stakes. Probably because it's terrifying —  remember that bit above about someone actually becoming homeless. I'm sitting here &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt; and wondering whether I should hit send on this, because I will then be publicly committed in a way that I can't take back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aw but hell I'm just a blind man on the plains,&lt;br&gt;
I drink my water when it rains,&lt;br&gt;
And live by chance among the lightning strikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am mortified thinking about what happens next year. I've never done anything so open-ended. Am I going to freak out under the pressure? Will I run out of money? What if I've been so public that I can't find normal work if things go poorly? Is this all stupid, and I should just keep compromising on my principles? How snarky will people be if I haven't earned money in six months? Will paying for music classes start feeling terrible? Can I still take my girlfriend on the same sorts of dates? Will I let the team down?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really don't know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I was recording a podcast episode with a good friend of mine, who is uprooting his entire life to move back to Columbia after a family emergency. At the very end, he reflected on his decade in Australia and the decision to move home to be with people he loves. The themes in that reflection were "I try to remember to have fun" and "This is terrifying".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have fun and be terrified. I can do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mecatol Rex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A blasted hellscape, scarred and pitted, haunted by the ghosts of ancient custodians who await the next fools to aspire for lordship over its husk-corpse. A million billion xenos of species innumerable have spilled synth-blood and soul across flagstones that have witnessed aeons of death, sacrificed at the altar of failed ambition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mecatol Rex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hollowed-out heart of the galaxy. The Hungering Throne, whose call reaches like siren-song across the cosmos, pulling at the threads of the greatest individuals the galaxy has ever seen, turning them from fruitful destiny to bloodied victims. It would be the height of folly to try wrench control of it for yourself, and require a disregard verging on manic recklessness for the numberless skulls lining the path to ascension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mecatol Rex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's &lt;em&gt;rightfully mine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i"&gt;I.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't wanna live forever, uh&lt;br&gt;
Shoot, punch, loot corpse, I ain't tryna live forever&lt;br&gt;
Yeah&lt;br&gt;
New gear, same stats, I ain't tryna live forever  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, I was invited by my now co-founder Stephen Deutsch to take a vaunted spot at his yearly Twilight Imperium IV game. It takes &lt;em&gt;thirteen hours&lt;/em&gt; to play. Children and partners are banished from abodes. Spotify playlists are constructed, featuring what I can only describe as a &lt;em&gt;distressing&lt;/em&gt; array of sonic warfare, appealing to neurodivergents of all ages. Factions and starting positions are drafted weeks in advance, with things being competitive enough that there's even a &lt;em&gt;ban&lt;/em&gt; phase to eliminate species that will interfere with your game plan. Alcohol flows freely as would-be contenders for the ancient throne of Mecatol Rex vie for power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have assembled a horrific, glass-and-faux-gold trophy. In the process, they have somehow misspelled &lt;em&gt;MECA&lt;/em&gt;TOL as &lt;em&gt;META&lt;/em&gt;COL, which has miraculously only increased its value. Sticky notes fly from it like the pennants of victorious warlords, resplendent with the winner's name, year of victory, and faction. It is truly hideous, and it is accordingly our fondest desire that our partners must resignedly accept that the winner is going to display it as prominently as possible in the living room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="PXL_20240806_073015241 (Medium).jpg" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/e18c401b.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is, of course, a long shot. I have never played the game, and the ruleset for a game that takes &lt;em&gt;thirteen hours&lt;/em&gt; is hardly going to be easy to learn. Napkin math looking at the number of winners listed on the trophy reveals that the other players brought &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; 260 hours of collective experience at the table. There are hundreds of cards that generate game-changing events, win conditions, factions, and to top it all off, a randomly generated board. Small mistakes in the first hour can ripple throughout the rest of the game and make victory impossible, consigning you to a miserable year long wait before the next attempt. Despite the reality of that, I had a good time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just kidding, I won, you absolute bastards, you should have known better than to bring someone that grew up in Asia to the table! You stupid idiots! This isn't a post-mortem, this is a &lt;em&gt;supervillain monologue&lt;/em&gt;. For decades my machinations lay undetected, and now you sordid sons of bitches are &lt;em&gt;dead&lt;/em&gt; and I am the fucking &lt;em&gt;emperor&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;space&lt;/em&gt;! Ahahahahahahahah—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-background"&gt;II. Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game takes place on a big map of the galaxy, at the center of which lies the legendary &lt;em&gt;Mecatol Rex&lt;/em&gt;, perhaps the most radical name in board game history, the seat of the space emperor's glorious throne. It is currently managed by the custodians, an alien race that is waiting to see which faction is the most worthy to rule. The goal of the game is to accomplish objectives which impress upon the imperial custodians that your faction is the most worthy. Whoever reaches ten points first gets the throne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-players-and-factions"&gt;The Players and Factions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone at the table has the ephemeral quality that all my readers call "getting it". It's whatever you need in your head to communicate effectively and not assert that all your issues are the result of not being "Agile enough", whatever the fuck that means. It also happens to be the thing you need to initiate the effective delivery of board game violence. Two of them are now directors at my consultancy. Everyone at the table was highly qualified in either technology or law, with the exception of Brendan, who is nonetheless the formidable avatar-made-mortal of high-functioning ADHD, and came closest to stealing my throne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stephen (The Nomad)&lt;/strong&gt;: The Nomad is a time traveler, who gets huge piles of money and can reposition his gigantic capital ship, presumably because he knows where every fight is going to happen and can manipulate the stock market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brendan (Argent Flight)&lt;/strong&gt;: The Argent Flight are a bunch of birds on a holy crusade. Typing that sentence made me realize that I am never going to be a mature adult. All their powers are based on political zeal and shooting down starfighters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David (The Winnu)&lt;/strong&gt;: David is playing as a bunch of sad exiled custodians, who seem to be universally regarded as the worst faction in the game. Their abilities are centered around making David stare at a board sadly for thirteen hours while his friends have fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ash (The Barony of Letnev)&lt;/strong&gt;: The Barony produces &lt;em&gt;tremendous&lt;/em&gt; volumes of slightly inferior spacecraft. Their flavour text reads "&lt;em&gt;Our armada will blot out the sun—when they die, they will die in darkness!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clem (Federation of Sol)&lt;/strong&gt;: The Federation of Sol are one of the strongest factions in the game, and are literally just humans doing a re-enactment of &lt;em&gt;Starship Troopers&lt;/em&gt;. They throw infantry at you until you die.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me (Titans of Ul)&lt;/strong&gt;: The Titans of Ul are a species of thousand-feet tall giants with a focus on exploration, terraforming, and gigantic space cannons (for self-defense). They have no physical or moral weaknesses, as per the Emperor's Declaration of 2023, following their glorious ascension to the throne. If you have any critiques of the Titans, please report to your local Mind Reforming office for immediate reprogramming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of drafting, I had no idea what factions were good, and I picked the Titans of Ul with the sophisticated strategy of wanting giant robots. A quick glance over their abilities made them seem weird as well, and this was my fundamental strategy at this early juncture: against a table of people with far more experience, I should aim for &lt;em&gt;asymmetry&lt;/em&gt; because an even playing field would probably result in losing. If the default is losing, I want as much variance as possible. You only get the trophy for &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; place, so losing extra hard did not bother me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-slice-selection"&gt;III. Slice Selection&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board is centered around Mecatol, and once you have selected your factions, you select the section of the galaxy that you start from. In a multiplayer game with a free-for-all setup, a great deal of the balancing is accomplished by players periodically teaming up against whoever is furthest ahead. Many game designers get lazy and let chaos handle the balancing, which makes playing well feel like a waste of time. Not so for Twilight Imperium IV. Placing yourself in a position that maximizes your chances of executing your game plan without interruption is probably the largest determinant of success. This is doubly true in systems where intervention is &lt;em&gt;not possible&lt;/em&gt; from players in certain board states. In something like Magic: The Gathering, it's usually pretty easy to attack any player you want at any time, especially if &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; attacking means you're going to lose anyway. In Twilight Imperium IV, you might find yourself unable to attack someone that you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want to due being physically incapable of reaching them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I knew from the draft chatter was that Stephen and Clem were considered to have the strongest faction picks. Yet this is the layout we ended up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Map_of_the_galaxy.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/b07496bf.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will see me&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; sandwiched between the two strongest players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As strange as it might sound, this is an incredibly advantageous position to be in. When you're the new player at a table, being sandwiched between the two strongest players is wonderful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing, you're valuable as a buffer between them. With six people at the table, it is in the interests of the leading players to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; mess with each other. You might think that they'd be competing for a victory, and while this will happen eventually, the &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; step is to convert that advantage to a position where you're just competing with one person. So they usually do not want to cut so far into your territory that they're now in contact with the other player, probably with weakened forces from aforementioned cutting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More cynically, no one wants to feel like they're beating up on the newbie, &lt;em&gt;particularly&lt;/em&gt; when their position looks generally untenable anyway. I try to take directions from a strong moral compass in real life, but this is a &lt;em&gt;board game&lt;/em&gt;, and thus the stakes are much higher. This is a no-ethics zone. If you die in real life, you lose at the board game, and that's &lt;em&gt;all that matters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the theme of asymmetry, you'll also note that there are two spaces of empty space here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Empty_spaces.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/1dba046a.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that to attack me, Stephen would have to move his fleet across two squares of empty space, providing some extra security. He's heavily incentivized to attack &lt;em&gt;away&lt;/em&gt; from me, as he doesn't get any incremental gains from seizing territory on his way to me. In fact, tracing a path from Stephen's home planet to mine only through squares with strategic value is the &lt;em&gt;longest&lt;/em&gt; of any position on the map between neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Stephen_pathing.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/ba3bdb49.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only reason to move up would be to eliminate me from the game entirely, which no one is going to do to a new player in the early game, on top of it being tactically unsound. I am similarly heavily incentivized to attack upwards, and I can trust that any early weakness in Clem's Federation of Sol setup will be immediately exploited by David on the other side of him, while I don't have to worry as much about Stephen doing the same to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv-preparation"&gt;IV. Preparation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next coin, make it to the next coin&lt;br&gt;
You grind or you figure out the exploit&lt;br&gt;
Well, fuck 'em, I'm just comin' for your neck, boy&lt;br&gt;
I don't need to save a thing, I don't need a checkpoint  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mustn't register on an emotional level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might argue that studying for a board game is against the spirit of fun, too serious, and even "psychotic". Very fair, but also have fun in the loser's bracket, dweebs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to do was ensure that I'm not making trivial mistakes on my first turns, as I would then be left to lament the tragic collapse of my victory chances over the next twelve hours. The rulebook is &lt;a href="https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/51/55/51552c7f-c05c-445b-84bf-4b073456d008/ti10_pok_living_rules_reference_20_web.pdf"&gt;forty-four pages long&lt;/a&gt;, but I do the same thing that I do before studying anything — take a moment to figure out whatever competent practitioners consider to be the best learning resources are&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This leads me to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_u2xEap5hBM"&gt;this YouTube video&lt;/a&gt;. By the time that the game day rolls around, my understanding is solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; thing I do is learn my own faction abilities, but we'll leave that to last for the purpose of clarity. Here, we'll first quickly assess the relative strength of the factions I'm up against.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nomad, Stephen's faction, appears to be mostly based around generating wealth and being able to teleport his flagship around the map. However, teleporting the flagship is limited to a system where he has ground forces, which is &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; for me because we're separated by empty space. This saves me some study, as it's unlikely that we're going to come to blows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clem's Federation of Sol, however, is another matter altogether. During the draft, there's much groaning that the faction is too strong, and a quick assessment of the faction is deeply concerning. For one thing, actions are taken using &lt;em&gt;command tokens&lt;/em&gt;, which are essentially the most important resource in the game. Players gain two command tokens per turn.... unless, you're the Federation of Sol, in which case you get an extra one and spawn free troops every turn. This represents a +50% improvement in action economy, which they are then going to use to deep strike human colonizers onto the ancestral homeland of my noble Titans like a thousand ants at my space picnic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other factions are not relevant mechanically to the rest of the story, other than noting that David's faction, the Winnu, the ones on the other side of Clem, were extremely sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we reflect on my own faction. They have a few very strange abilities, but only a handful are relevant. Firstly, when they visit planets, they're able to &lt;em&gt;explore&lt;/em&gt; them. Exploration can generate incremental improvements to your planets, but the Titans leave behind tokens that can eventually be transformed into Planetary Defense Systems (PDS), i.e, Giant Space Cannons. This is good for two reasons: firstly, it allows me to incrementally improve my territory without engaging in overt aggression, so fights can break out amongst the rest of the table first. Secondly, the Titans have the strongest PDS in the game, the Hel-Titan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial version of it has this stat card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Hel-Titan I.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/6ee67792.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing too crazy, but it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have a special line of text saying that it's both a unit and a structure. I believe this is mostly there because Hel-Titans can fight in ground actions against opposing infantry unlike a normal PDS, which is &lt;em&gt;nice&lt;/em&gt;, but is not going to stop the endless hordes of Federation of Sol foot soldiers. I'm going to be in a &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; way if I end up relying on that extensively. Nonetheless, file that way for now. Hel-Titans are both ground forces and structures. It's important later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;upgraded&lt;/em&gt; version of the card looks like this&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Hel-Titan II.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/79a0fa47.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that it can fire into &lt;em&gt;adjacent&lt;/em&gt; systems, allowing for some offensive usage. This means that I can perform extensive area denial, but I'm still unable to drag the cannons into new positions to support offensives. Plus firing a few shots is hardly a game-changing level of firepower. Nonetheless, I know what my unique advantages are, and they're my Giant Space Cannons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the last thing to do is be aware of what can happen in the game. It relies heavily on cards, both to represent technological advances (which are non-random) and to represent hidden victory conditions or political agendas that we will be called on to vote for (which &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; random). There are approximately fifty pieces of technology, sixty objectives to score, and thirty political agendas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do what any reasonable software engineer would do and read them all, taking note of those that interact with Giant Space Cannons. We have a game plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v-the-first-two-turns"&gt;V. The First Two Turns&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A game of Twilight Imperium IV typically lasts six turns, so the first two turns represent the entirety of the early game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the day, I have enough self-respect to admit that I've learned the rules well, but I leave it at that. The &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; thing I do is simply focus on occupying the planets closest to my home, developing those sectors as aggressively as possible while avoiding coming into direct conflict with Clem's Federation of Sol. Stephen and I leave each other alone. The running joke is that everyone is everyone else's "oldest and most trusted ally" as we try to balance wanting an advantage in resources against not expending ourselves too early in a dubious war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal in this early stage is to score a point or so per turn, which is the community's rough guideline for new players to know if they're doing okay, build space cannons, and beeline for a piece of technology called Hyper Metabolism. All this does is allow me to gain three actions a turn, the thing that the Federation of Sol gets for free, but I knew going in that I would need it to compete. The earlier I get it, the more actions I'm getting over the course of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is at this point that David blunders. He extends one of his larger spaceships into empty space, where it cannot reasonably pose a threat to anyone. It's really just floating there, alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="David_mistake.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/fa969917.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clem immediately directs the Federation of Sol to &lt;em&gt;ruthlessly&lt;/em&gt; crush the ship. Doesn't even think about it for a second on his turn, just picks up the pieces and absolutely fucking rinses&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the poor man, which sets David up for a slow and painful slide out of the competition. I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have paid more attention to how mercilessly Clem executed this move, but I was too busy appreciating that the table was &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; as cutthroat as I had been told, which means that I didn't have to feel bad about what I had planned for later. This almost kills me later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we exit the early game, I've successfully beelined for Hyper Metabolism, and now have a solid action economy. I've planted PDS units in these two sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="early_planets.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/7e9d221d.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also used a few of my more minor powers to assist David's Winnu against Clem's Federation of Sol, both to build relations and to keep a proxy war running against Clem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vi-mid-game"&gt;VI. Mid-Game&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we enter the third round, there are four players in contention for the win. Stephen has failed to score enough points, and is trailing far behind everyone else despite a reasonably strong fleet and economy. David has mistakenly flown his fleet into a Cormund, a planet next to a black hole so strong that it is ripping his ships apart as they try to leave orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="gravity_well.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/abb6a0e0.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot emphasize enough how much this session sucked for David. His faction was already trash-tier, his fleet is being ripped apart by a black hole, his starting dreadnought is eviscerated in the opening salvo of a war by the combined forces of humanity, and it was all just downhill from there. At one point, David was forced to pitch a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; Winnu deep space fighter against a War Sun from Ash's Barony of Letnev. A fighter is an X-wing and a War Sun is a fucking &lt;em&gt;Death Star&lt;/em&gt;. Suffice it to say that David has not been having a good time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clem is doing well, as the Federation of Sol is grabbing whatever territory it wants from David's Winnu, held back only by a desire not to leave his home systems open to invasion by me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ash's Barony has been competing with Brendan's Argent Flight, with the Argent Flight looking like it's slightly ahead, but they're both still in contention. However, they're on the other side of the board and not my problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, my play has been quiet. Lots of exploring my own planets and building up some minor improvements. I have four PDS units, which is the maximum allowed, and typically not a very intelligent move. However, I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have a hidden objective to destroy an enemy carrier with a deep space cannon. That's &lt;em&gt;normally&lt;/em&gt; hard to do because you have to convince someone to move a carrier into your space, but this is the moment that I activate the first of my two surprise moves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clem has stationed some carriers between my foremost planets and his home system... so I upgrade my two foremost PDS units into Hel-Titan II's with the deep space cannon capability I mentioned earlier and &lt;em&gt;light them the fuck up&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="cannons_one.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/8e1ceed9.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That scores me a quick point, and it is at this point that it becomes apparent that my entire section of the board has become a horrific kill-field. The two frontier sectors of my burgeoning empire have two PDS units each, which exert an absolutely horrendous zone-of-influence. The green box below indicates that due to how they're positioned, they can also fire to support each other against an invasion fleet that attempts to take out the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Kill_Field.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/76aa4efa.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is backed by a reasonable fleet of powerful Saturn Engine II cruisers, one of the Titans' signature ships, to make matters worse for anyone that wants to try test the borders. It was not quite impenetrable, but anyone that poured sufficient resources into tackling it was going to be easy prey for their other neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clem's Federation of Sol had over-extended badly, with a fleet in orbit over Mecatol Rex, so I moved in and grabbed one of his planets. My thinking here was clear. He was in an extremely strong position, controlled Mecatol Rex which yields a respectable number of points, and it was obvious that contesting the land grab would result in the bloodiest turn of the game. The truth is that I am still totally confident that 99% of people would have complained a bit, wallowed, then backed off and looked for a way to lose gracefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where I almost lost the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember earlier when I mentioned that I wished I had paid more attention when Clem summarily executed David's helpless dreadnought? Yeah, it turns out that that Clem has ice for blood and is not held back by trivialities like "human frailty" or "hesitation". In a display of terrifying calculation, he thinks for a measly thirty seconds, then takes &lt;em&gt;every unit&lt;/em&gt; he has on the map and throws &lt;em&gt;all of them&lt;/em&gt; at my frontline, leaving Mecatol Rex undefended. I've never seen someone accept an ugly reality so readily or emotionlessly. I did not realize people could bypass the &lt;code&gt;salt&lt;/code&gt; module in their brains and skip straight to retaliation. He throws &lt;em&gt;so many&lt;/em&gt; troops at me that they simply &lt;em&gt;absorb&lt;/em&gt; the fire from the cannon line, absorb &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; fire as they drop troops through the stratosphere, then his infantry beat my PDS units (which are probably canonically just big Titans holding railguns) to death. And I'm certain he does this because he just instantly accepted that it was &lt;em&gt;endless bloodshed&lt;/em&gt; or lose over the next four turns, and there's no point delaying the amputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm scared of lawyers now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then take all of &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; troops and launch a counter-offensive. It comes down to a coin flip at the end. By the time the slaughter is over, we both have next to nothing on the board, prompting Stephen to simply remark that we had both "lost a lot of plastic".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vii-late-game-and-the-master-plan"&gt;VII. Late Game and the Master Plan&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ain't tryna live it like a side quest, yeah&lt;br&gt;
I'm nice enough to kill 'em all with kindness&lt;br&gt;
I been indoors through the winter, yeah&lt;br&gt;
My dick's worth a hundred plus charisma&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We break for dinner, having played for around seven hours at this point. Brendan notes that I look &lt;em&gt;too confident&lt;/em&gt;, but this is an important part of your civic duty as the villain. If you're going to &lt;em&gt;win&lt;/em&gt;, you owe the people the consolation of being as ungracious as possible, so that they have something to rail against before the next session. This also applies to running things like D&amp;amp;D, regardless of what cowards tell you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was not obvious to the other players at the table, but at this late stage in the game my economy is fantastically strong. In fact, it's so strong that I realize I can create the maximum allowable number of my ultra-strong cruisers every turn, and they move so fast that I can put them into orbit over Mecatol Rex &lt;em&gt;every turn&lt;/em&gt;. The only way for them to realize this is to manually count over all the little numbers of my side of the board, which no one does because they had no reason to until now. So the first thing I do on the next turn is rebuild my entire fleet, rebuild my Hel-Titans, and then &lt;em&gt;activate my master plan&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way that moving ships and starting combat around is that a player takes a &lt;em&gt;command token&lt;/em&gt;, one of those three tokens you get per turn, and put it down on a tile. This is how you decide what tiles things happen in, and when things happen, they &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; happen. You can move ships into that orbit, build units... and space cannons are allowed to fire. Even if the command token doesn't belong to the player that owns the space cannons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was planning, it flagged for me that &lt;em&gt;building units&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;firing space cannons&lt;/em&gt; are both triggered by the same thing—placing command tokens. Which means, hypothetically, if you were to get deep space cannons next to someone's home world, you would be allowed to fire at their fleet every time they tried to rebuild it. They put the token on, &lt;em&gt;you fire&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; they're allowed to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the difficulty is that you can't move PDS units. Even my special Hel-Titans that are units &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; structures can't be transported, meaning that you can't load them into a carrier and fly them anywhere. It's specifically mentioned on the card, because they knew someone would try some bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Hel-Titan II.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/79a0fa47.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except there's a piece of technology called Transit Diodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="transit-diodes.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/efcc2049.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my early study, the two dying neurons that enable me to write software had fired, and I note that it does not say to &lt;em&gt;transport&lt;/em&gt; units. It says to &lt;em&gt;remove ground forces&lt;/em&gt;, which my Hel-Titans explicitly are, and &lt;em&gt;place them on a planet&lt;/em&gt;. They aren't even the same Hel-Titans, I'm &lt;em&gt;deleting them from memory&lt;/em&gt; and then instantiating new ones elsewhere. &lt;em&gt;Transporting&lt;/em&gt; has not happened, because that would be illegal. So on Turn 5, I research Transit Diodes and send Clem straight to the fucking Shadow Realm by teleporting my massive gunline adjacent to his home planet. The only escape is into the consolidated remnants of David's Winnu fleet &lt;em&gt;or the black hole planet that eats your ships&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="DIE.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/50210220.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agent Smith: I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species and I realized that you're not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment but you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You're a plague and we are the cure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human threat has been &lt;em&gt;contained&lt;/em&gt;. Every turn the Federation of Sol is forced to eat a barrage of four deep space cannon rounds, then &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; four as I spite-activate his system then neglect to move into it, and &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; four if his fleet flies anywhere in range of my cannons, and then &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; four if my cannons are still operational when my inevitable vengeance fleet arrives, and &lt;em&gt;then they have to fight my whole fleet anyway&lt;/em&gt;. This is Titan of Ul territory now, and everyone should be &lt;em&gt;grateful&lt;/em&gt; because we are &lt;em&gt;benevolent&lt;/em&gt;, two thousand feet tall, and I've heard that height is correlated with being an executive. What is the emperor of Mecatol Rex if not the universe's greatest CEO?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="viii-endgame"&gt;VIII. Endgame&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We enter the final turn. The first thing that happens is that David's Winnu, as thanks for all the help through the early game fighting off Clem's horde of testosterone-fueled humans, gives me Support for the Throne, a mechanic which gives me one point. Remember this moment the next time you feel that you don't matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now I have the capacity to obliterate any faction on the board in outright war, save from Brendan's Argent Flight, who have been dominating the other side of the board. We win at 10 points, and we're both on 8. You're only allowed to score one &lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt; objective per turn (everyone is competing for these), and another &lt;em&gt;secret&lt;/em&gt; objective per turn, which is unique to you. You're allowed to buy secret objectives, and I spend my last few resources picking up a new one, because I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; one to have a chance at scoring 10 points this round. You win the &lt;em&gt;moment&lt;/em&gt; you score the 10th point, and Brendan is before me in the turn order. If I do not win &lt;em&gt;this turn&lt;/em&gt;, Brendan will simply score another public objective next round and it's over. He's too far away on the map for me to intervene, and similarly powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brendan scores his 9th point with a public objective. I wait with bated breath. He does not score his secret objective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I score a public objective, bringing me &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; 9th point. Everyone waits to see if they still have a chance at winning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember how I read all the cards, way at the beginning, to understand what my win conditions were? I had done some crude calculations to work out how likely it was I could force one, and the numbers were good. I look down at my secret objective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="establish_a_perimeter.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/d807322e.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ix"&gt;IX.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told you how it is, I ain't tryna, ah, forget it&lt;br&gt;
Yeah&lt;br&gt;
High score, game over, I don't need another credit&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This Escalated Quickly&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned one post ago that this blog has done approximately 2M+ lifetime views, with over a million of them being in the past two weeks in response to the now-infamous &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-will-fucking-piledrive-you-if-you-mention-ai-again/"&gt;rant about AI&lt;/a&gt;, then I went out of my way to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; write the most maximally viral thing possible for personal don't-be-a-clickbaiting-grifter&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; reasons. But to say that the blog has done a lot of traffic is actually a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; understatement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been understating the madness of the last few weeks because it took me a while to even figure out if it was a flash in the pan or something that is just my life now. I don't have any experience with how blog posts should do, so I genuinely didn't know if a million hits was "pretty good" or "Jesus Christ". On the previous occasions that my writing has done well, that merely resulted in getting enough email that I had to dedicate a few hours of time to reply to all of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; time around, it's just at a whole new level. My anonymity is totally gone. I have 318 unread emails, maybe another 500 lengthy messages on LinkedIn (which, despite the medium, are all thoughtful). I've joked before about making the Clout Number that is LinkedIn followers go up to terrorize empty suits, but I now have &lt;em&gt;three thousand&lt;/em&gt; even though the only way to find me on LinkedIn is to &lt;em&gt;navigate to my homepage, to the About Me, then to my profile&lt;/em&gt;. Do you know &lt;em&gt;how much work&lt;/em&gt; that is in internet terms? There are companies that could 5x their revenue by removing that many steps from finding the purchase button. The worst part is that it's all wasted on me, I don't even know what you do with LinkedIn followers, so I've just been mocking people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="LinkedIn_Post.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/ffb8f1bc.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend Stephen Deutsch once told me to proceed by the light of the bridges I'm burning. He was joking but I've realized that my greatest weakness is that I can't stop myself from taking advice, even bad advice, if it sounds witty enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been on &lt;a href="https://www.iheart.com/podcast/139-better-offline-150284547/episode/i-will-piledrive-you-if-you-191631096/"&gt;an episode of Better Offline&lt;/a&gt; with Ed Zitron and Robert Evans. Zitron called me cool on air, which is now going to be the first line of my CV for the rest of my life. There are episodes inbound of Screaming in the Cloud, the MLOps Community podcast, Byte Marx, the Joe Reis&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Show, and 1984 Today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TIME magazine has asked me to provide a quote on AI influencers. I don't even know if that's a big deal — I only see people talk about them when they put Putin and Hitler on the front cover, which I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; is only funny in hindsight, but this &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; hindsight so it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; funny. I know this might reek of hubris, but I think I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; pick a hundred people in a row and miraculously end up with no fascists, hit me up if you'd like tips. Also, having now read the quality of tech journalism out there to prepare for interviews, the temptation to start sinking the industry's battleships by just doing their job better is very strong (though the journalist from TIME, Rebecca Schneid, was a delightful conversation partner and clearly phenomenally intelligent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another magazine, affiliated with an institution that took A$12,000 from me when I was immigrating to rubber stamp that I'm a certified software engineer, reached out for a quote on an anti-AI piece, and I got to send them this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciate you reaching out, and the piece sounds good! Unfortunately, I do have some familiarity with the [ORG], and it was all related to how the organization extracts money from immigrants (read: me) to rubber stamp their I.T credentials during the [COURSE ON EMAIL WRITING FOR FILTHY FOREIGNERS]. Also between the two of us, the only [ORG] members I've met in the workplace have been ancient demi-liches with minimal talent held together by nothing but grift and willingness to commit political violence. Blink twice (or email me from a personal address) if they're holding you hostage.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't worked out if I have a media policy yet, but suffice it to say that "don't work with the [ORG]" is probably part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This did not actually do anything to recoup my losses, the journalists were not personally to blame outside of working for an organization that &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; did some sneaky inside deals with a politician&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and realistically this was simply throwing away a chance at seeming more important than I actually am, but &lt;em&gt;fuck it&lt;/em&gt;, we didn't get here by compromising. Proceed as you intend to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also there is something incredibly funny about watching people &lt;em&gt;very carefully&lt;/em&gt; thank you for your time without acknowledging anything else in the email because their true feelings might be used against them by the decrepit poltergeists that haunt the executive suites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am slated to give a talk at GDG Melbourne, demo it on Primagen's Twitch channel before the big day, and am hoping to give another talk at &lt;a href="https://dddperth.com/"&gt;DDD&lt;/a&gt; alongside noted absolute unit &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU0B0ZGUaaI"&gt;Stefan Prandl&lt;/a&gt;. And there's another talk that I'm thinking about attending in Vegas in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also going to appear as a voice of anti-LLM reason in a documentary, which will finally convince my extremely conservative father that I have not tanked my career by going too hard. Despite what grifters would like you to think, if you aren't from a &lt;em&gt;hypermarginalized&lt;/em&gt; community it is very difficult to go too hard, and you'll know you're there when you wake up in a cold sweat with a half-assembled molotov clutched in your hands. Disclaimer: This advice may not apply in the U.S, where I have heard that in many states you can be fired for so much as thinking that the boss has made a mistake at any point in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone has shipped me an early copy of their to-be-released book in case the &lt;em&gt;possibility&lt;/em&gt; of a review might drive traffic to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, I woke up and an editor reached out to offer me the opportunity to get a book published, which I am &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; going to accept after doing some due diligence on what to look for in a publisher, which includes such wonderful phrases as "free rein", "no rush", and "please don’t dropkick me"&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I'm trying to say is that &lt;em&gt;things have escalated extremely quickly&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-the-mad-pathway-to-get-here"&gt;II. The Mad Pathway To Get Here&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite authors, Nassim Taleb, is huge on the idea that the real world is pure chaos, and the incorrect belief that it isn't merely leads to people blundering constantly. The rough idea is that you want to maximize the areas of your life that are exposed to opportunity, preferably the kind that you can decline if the opportunity sucks. That is to say, don't hang out in a dark room all day, every day, if you're looking to live an exciting life. I live much of my life with that principle in mind, and point myself in an approximately nice-looking direction then accept that I'll end up somewhere totally different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know this blog was &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be about how to run fantasy tabletop RPGs effectively? Ludic isn't an inversion of lucid as most people guess, it means &lt;em&gt;relating to play&lt;/em&gt; and is a reference to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludic_fallacy"&gt;Taleb's ludic fallacy&lt;/a&gt;, which is the misapplication of simplistic game systems to the complexity of the real world. There's still a post in draft sitting at 5.5K words that I estimated would be finished at &lt;em&gt;50K&lt;/em&gt; which is mostly about how to be a good Game Master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, I wrote a blog post about my experience studying undergraduate psychology&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which did a thousand views on the first day. It was critical of epistemic and quality issues with how the field is approached at the undergraduate level. At the time, I had just graduated near the top of a major Australian university's Honours course, which tend to be hyper-competitive, not due to difficulty in the course material, but due to the fact that this is the main pathway to the very prestigious profession of clinical psychologist. Between us, as is a recurring theme on this blog, it was not actually very hard. Most of the other students refused to open their textbooks or start assignments the day before they were due. I was also interviewing to become a clinical neuropsychologist at the University of Melbourne, which I didn't succeed at &lt;em&gt;but even getting an interview as an international student is hard as hell&lt;/em&gt;. Plus I had tested most of my theories about the dysfunction of the university system by starting a small statistics tutoring business, where I showed students how to weaponize psychology &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; unserious academics. It did well enough that I probably could have filled my 9 to 5 with students if I had wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So of course, the internet being the internet, a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/a1raex/comment/eat1fje/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button"&gt;very smart person on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; accused me of secretly failing, and then another genius insisted that I'm &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/a1raex/comment/eathpw1/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button"&gt;probably a Scientologist&lt;/a&gt;. Some people do not merely have smooth brains, they pride themselves on running their minds through an industrial QCM-SRP1300 Wide Belt Sander every morning. Then, amidst a swirling cloud of mangled neurons, they will insist that &lt;em&gt;ackshually&lt;/em&gt; you're in a cult. Perish, dorks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all you need to understand about why it is totally okay &lt;em&gt;not to care&lt;/em&gt; what some people think. Namely, that some people &lt;em&gt;do not think&lt;/em&gt; under any reasonable definition of the word. One of the funniest things that David Gerard told me when I started writing is that I can probably afford to be bold, because he survived tussling with Scientologists for real, which permanently blew out his threat detector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/terry_pratchett_600502"&gt;There are some people who hate my guts. But that goes with the territory.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I changed the headline of that blog to "very little in terms of intellectual content", because &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/compliments/"&gt;you've got to laugh or you'll cry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I never really followed up on that writing success. This is going to sound &lt;em&gt;incredibly dumb&lt;/em&gt;, but I got so caught up trying to figure out how the website should &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; that I averaged a year between posts, before finally taking the website down because I didn't have a permanent work visa and was unexpectedly working with psychologists. I didn't want to find out if they had a self-reflective sense of humour and appreciation for epistemology the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote another small piece on Taleb's narrative fallacy, which &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; did a few hundred views immediately, but I once again failed to follow up. If there's a lesson here for readers, it's that you can generate an audience &lt;em&gt;very consistently&lt;/em&gt; even though luck is a major factor in how each individual piece goes. And also that you should be smarter than me and actually keep writing instead of getting stunlocked by font choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While slaving over a chapter describing the game theory of lying to your players about what you rolled, I had a very frustrating day at work. I can't even remember what happened. I suspect someone just talked about Agile a little bit too much as I desperately begged them to understand that 0% test coverage is a problem. Since the blog already existed, I took two hours to knock out an article where I lamented that most of my work in the tech space seemed like it was being thrown away, as a total afterthought chucked in onto Hackernews, then went to bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon waking up, I was greeted by the startling knowledge that it had been #1 on Hackernews, something that &lt;em&gt;seemed like it might be a big deal&lt;/em&gt; but I had no real way of knowing if it was a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept writing this time because I had chosen this precise platform because it was marketed as having no settings to mess with. Readership gradually built up, and currently &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; post in the backlog does between 200-500 hits &lt;em&gt;per day&lt;/em&gt;, up from 10 per day last February. I have met a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of astounding people that are on the same spiritual wavelength as me, and was pretty happy for this state of affairs to persist. &lt;em&gt;Just&lt;/em&gt; enough attention to maybe give a fun talk at some point, maybe get a few job opportunities at nice companies, possibly generate a lead or two for consulting with the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I wrote a rant about AI which I expected to do 20K views, and now I'm worrying about how to tell if a printed book is going to have decent quality before signing with a publisher. Page feel is very important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-why-me"&gt;III. Why Me?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had to think deeply on whether I should accept all the attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the recurring jokes in David Edding's &lt;em&gt;Belgariad&lt;/em&gt; is that characters, especially young ones, will ask the ancient sorcerer Belgarath &lt;em&gt;why they were chosen for something&lt;/em&gt;, which alternates between frustrating the hell out of the old man and amusing him to no end. There is, of course, no point in asking "Why me?" because life just happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first thought when most of this kicked off was, and I cannot emphasize this enough, I am some random guy with five years of industry experience who &lt;em&gt;happens to be good at writing&lt;/em&gt;. Writing skill is not totally uncorrelated with aptitude for a field, but only insofar as you must &lt;em&gt;genuinely&lt;/em&gt; have intuition for a field's underlying principles in order to draw links between areas to produce novelties. This is a complicated way of saying "I'm a better writer than I am a programmer", and the immediate temptation is to pass on the attention for fear of being in over one's head. So, why me? Well... because. That's all, because. I have Eddings to thank for being at peace with that answer. Things just happen when you put yourself out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I do have some more sophisticated thoughts on &lt;em&gt;why me&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is that I now view all fields as consisting of a bimodal distribution, which is how nerds say there are two types of people. That is, there is a huge clump of people that have not studied, have no particular talent for the thing they do professionally, but have nonetheless drifted into the field because it was a default. Some of the worst offenders I know in corporate settings are phenomenal parents or talented artists, and they do just do office work because it's easy to default into with no effort. Remember all those people that really wanted to get into HR at university? No? That probably explains why HR, real estate agents, and recruiters all seem largely disengaged in a way that is shocking to the rest of us. You'll hear people handwave this and say it's fine because they're just earning a living, and that's true until you realize that they work in hospitals and burn the billions of dollars necessary to compensate nurses respectfully. It's understandable, justifiable, and even I've benefited from those jobs, but it isn't &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every single person I've spoken to in the past two weeks, from all industries, has quietly conceded that most of their field is run by people that have no business doing so. Don't panic, but this includes doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I know many people that are much smarter and wiser than me, I at least &lt;em&gt;have opinions&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;try hard&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt;. I've self-certified myself as not being totally incompetent, which I know is a bold move in 2024, where everyone is encouraged to be maximally humble at all times to provide struggling psychologists with an endless supply of imposter syndrome work.&lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Sincerely trying makes you good enough to be refreshing in a world that is filled by what my friend Courtney Brandabur calls "microphone guys". They just get the microphone and won't shut the fuck up even though we'd all like them too. Every night before bed, they gargle the words "innovation" and "alignment" until they're soaked in disgusting grifter saliva. The world isn't starved for my dubious engineering talent, it's starved for someone that can write decently, understands the fundamentals of the craft, and &lt;em&gt;most importantly&lt;/em&gt; is willing to say risky things. I know this horrid state of affairs is true because otherwise &lt;em&gt;someone with more experience would have been picked&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, my writing is obviously inflammatory. That makes for good listening. On Zitron's podcast, I accused Agile of being so many layers of terrible copying away from the original manifesto that "we're on Kamino but the clones have eight heads".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, grifters have &lt;em&gt;such a comprehensive stranglehold&lt;/em&gt; on the global corporate stage that the world is dying for someone to just say what we can all see. I can &lt;em&gt;see the wishful thinking happening&lt;/em&gt;. It is very, very easy to transmute yourself into a thought leader. If I had lied and said my company did a hundred million dollars in revenue this year, journalists would have accepted it totally uncritically because they &lt;em&gt;want it to be true&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of people who shared my writing described me as an "expert data scientist" and an "industry leader".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expert data scientist, that's &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; true, I'll concede, but I'm well out of practice and only talk about a university competition I cleaned up in. And, of course, people who &lt;em&gt;actually &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/breaking-my-universitys-machine-learning-competition/"&gt;read the linked article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; will note that I cleaned up via normal computer science, not machine learning! Ya boy even wins his AI competitions without using AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industry leader, on the other hand, that's just wishful thinking. People &lt;em&gt;want me to be an industry leader&lt;/em&gt; because they're craving an authority figure to confirm their feelings, but I &lt;em&gt;don't run enough analytics to know if I am&lt;/em&gt;, so how could &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; know that? All my traffic could be Bobby "F5" Johnson from Rockford, Illinois, who compulsively refreshes every page on this blog a thousand times a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that aside — much of that isn't a great reason to have a platform — it's clear to me that there's an opportunity to do something good. Grifters and hype will always exist, but loudly pushing back against those egos and bubbles is valuable work. More importantly, it's something that I'm uniquely positioned to do that other people can't right now, no matter how good they are at software engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received an &lt;em&gt;astonishing&lt;/em&gt; amount of correspondence from non-technicians who tolerated by Postgres and try/catch jokes simply because they were so, so tired of hearing clowns tell them that ChatGPT is going to replace their jobs. The very dweebs who gloat about LLMs revolutionizing society &lt;em&gt;are the ones on the chopping block&lt;/em&gt; and they're trying to scare &lt;em&gt;other people&lt;/em&gt;. The first people to go &lt;em&gt;will be Deloitte consultants&lt;/em&gt; because LLMs are very good at emitting bullshit — that's not their only use case, but it's obviously their &lt;em&gt;main one&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me ask everyone in the audience this, both technical and non-technical — what is harder &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;? Getting ChatGPT to produce a &lt;em&gt;passable&lt;/em&gt; strategy for a large business, or getting artificial intelligence to navigate meatspace to fix someone's plumbing? Given the answer, do you think &lt;em&gt;plumbers&lt;/em&gt; are going out of work before people that make Gantt charts for a living? I am going to spend a year repeating this question to every dickhead that brings this up, preferably on stages in front of large audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, I would be dishonest if I didn't admit this was a major factor, I've been having a lot of fun with the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv-what-now"&gt;IV. What Now?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What now? This is the thing that I've been wrestling with over the past two weeks. It is becoming apparent that the attention will quiet down, but not enough for opportunities to stop cropping up. My main goal for the year, which was simply to ship one web app for blog readers to play around with to a standard that my mentors approve of, is probably off the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; thing is that I have to make sure those talks are good as I can make them. I'll make posts here as they come out in case people are interested. I'm estimating that it will take take &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; an hour per minute going into each talk, and that's because some of the audiences are small. I'm delivering between 30 and 120 minutes of talk by the end of the year, so there's going to be some serious hustling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I have to make sure that I somehow find some time to study —  I've slacked on this while handling everything, and haven't seriously made email headway. A platform without matching self-development is one of the fundamental manifestations of grifting, alongside TED talks and being rewarded with speaking engagements after purchasing enterprise software. Plus, you &lt;em&gt;can't write well&lt;/em&gt; without reading widely, and I must make some time for that too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, of course, writing a book, possibly two. This is something that I've wanted to do since I was old enough to distress my Southeast Asian parents by naming careers that weren't doctor and lawyer. However, I was expecting to self-publish for a readership of, let me check those core demographics, my mother. Instead, it looks like I'm going to have one fiction book being self-published and something else aimed at the technology sector specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've decided not to even try to writing full-time. I sincerely believe this would cause the quality of my writing to suffer, as any writer needs a certain amount of contact with reality to continue producing meaningful content, and lounging around the house all day writing is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; sufficient contact for the type of thing I write about. I &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; try this if a career in fiction writing takes off, but that would address a completely different audience, and we honestly have no clue if I'm any good at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I am seriously considering a six to twelve month sabbatical from my part-time job in order to clear time for technical study&lt;sup id="fnref:7"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and getting those books done. This is very expensive for me, but the current moment feels like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I still have &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/Ludic190"&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.liberapay.com/Ludic/"&gt;Liberapay&lt;/a&gt; and shows of support are always appreciated, but I cannot emphasize this enough, &lt;em&gt;it will not increase my writing output&lt;/em&gt;, and I have sufficient savings to survive the sabbatical. I've received somewhat mixed advice on this, with Ed Zitron noting that it probably helps to &lt;em&gt;mention&lt;/em&gt; it's possible to support me, and Corey Quinn noting that it leaves a bad taste in the mouth for readers to feel like they're being shaken for money. The worst part is that both of those things sounds right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've stuck the links up above, and I'll add some disclaimers. Supporting me through either channel &lt;em&gt;will not make me write more&lt;/em&gt; —  I write when the inspiration hits me, and I can't force more out for money while keeping quality. This blog will never be paywalled, the podcast is not paywalled with no plans to change this, and I intend to earn my living from programming for spiritual reasons and to avoid audience capture — the day that my lived experience totally diverges from that of the reader is probably the day that I stop writing. The only reason to chuck a few dollars in is to reassure me that people like my work enough to help me if my writing makes me unemployable at large companies, which I have been warned is already happening. Previously readers would say that they'd give me an internal referral but hide the blog in case it upset their managers, but this is obviously no longer actually possible. I still don't know if the typical company would welcome me for my values or if they're too worried about the consequences of to inviting the grifter's apex predator into food chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All future Patreon/Liberapay plugs will only happen once a year because I still find them distasteful, starting July 2025. And, because this probably matters to the engineers in the audience, Liberapay takes a much smaller share then Patreon &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; is committed to supporting free and open-source software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My podcast may run an ad read or two if I find a sponsor with a product that I actually like, as I'm now busy enough that editing them is actually an ordeal. I'm not sure what this would actually mean, because the only tech products that have given me nothing but warm fuzzy feelings in recent memory are &lt;a href="https://www.reaper.fm/"&gt;REAPER&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.zsa.io/moonlander"&gt;ZSA Moonlander&lt;/a&gt;, and they &lt;em&gt;are right now&lt;/em&gt; getting plugged on my largest platform for free. Uh, I don't know anything about this, hit me up if you know how to get ethical podcast sponsors, I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v"&gt;V.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to recap, it's all pretty straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just have to prepare for two talks, fly to meet readers in Europe, get Australian citizenship so I can do a 2025 speaking engagement in Vegas, be in a documentary, handle a few more podcast episodes, keep producing my &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; podcast, ship the application that'll get me into software Valhalla, complete books such as &lt;em&gt;How Linux Works&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Writing a Compiler in Go&lt;/em&gt;,  write a fiction &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a non-fiction book, deal with the business coming to my consultancy, take care of my girlfriend who is currently dealing with Covid isolation, prepare for a theater performance in December, practice my first student performance for my music school, give career advice to all the students that reached out, try out my first journalism gig for a major U.S publication, get a coffee every weekday in the city with a reader, try to connect everyone that emailed me with someone in their local area who can help them with their job searches, and keep interviewing for good day jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh fu—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hackernews moderation suspected that I was &lt;em&gt;trying to write clickbait&lt;/em&gt;, but I was actually doing my best &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to. Adding the word "fucking" to a title historically &lt;em&gt;reduces&lt;/em&gt; traffic because of being flagged for profanity. I only used it because the naming pattern from my previous rants was more important to me than views. You can see HN moderator dang's analysis &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40735538"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and while dang is genuinely awesome, this is such a delightfully engineer-brained (pejorative) take. An optimized clickbait title would have &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; been something like "I am going to personally burst the AI bubble and there will be no survivors". XOXO still love you, dang.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just realized &lt;em&gt;while writing this&lt;/em&gt; that this must be the same Joe Reis that wrote &lt;em&gt;Fundamentals of Data Engineering&lt;/em&gt;, so, you know, wow.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I'm Malaysian, my &lt;em&gt;grandfather&lt;/em&gt; was bribing cops well into his 70s. I can trace the corruption like a bloodhound.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No idea how to pick an editor, but I know a sense of humor when I see one.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've saved this to republish one day, so everyone can see how much my writing has changed over a few years.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:6"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is entirely serious, but the thing I receive &lt;em&gt;the most criticism for&lt;/em&gt; is daring to take a position &lt;em&gt;between&lt;/em&gt; "I am the worst engineer on the planet" and "I am the reincarnation of Grace Hopper". Most of the people who ask me for advice are clearly in the top 5% of competence but think they're in the bottom 20%. If you're bothering to worry if you're bad then you're &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:6" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:7"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may sound strange to &lt;em&gt;leave work&lt;/em&gt; to get better at engineering, but I still have not found an employer in Melbourne that hits the trifecta of currently hiring, being known to me, and having engineers that I want to learn from, though I've seen a million places that hit two of those requirements.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:7" title="Jump back to footnote 7 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/my-glorious-ascension-to-thought-leadership/</guid></item><item><title>On Burnout, Mental Health, And Not Being Okay</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/on-burnout-mental-health-and-not-being-okay/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This blog did so many hits last week that the host platform experienced timeouts. I've been invited onto podcasts, and offered both small technical projects and &lt;em&gt;journalism&lt;/em&gt; work, of all things. It was a crazy time. But the internet moves on, as it always does, and I am left, as we all always are, to figure out what to write about next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thread that runs through the emails I get is, surprisingly, one about mental health, though I didn't recognize it as such at first. Consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found your blog today and, Jesus Christ, reading it made me feel sane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first few times I received emails like this, I thought of them &lt;em&gt;purely&lt;/em&gt; as commentary on how out of place people feel when they're surrounded by the strange dysfunction that descends upon most organizations. But then &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; people write in to tell me that they're burned out after going through the above for long enough, which gives the whole thing a much more concerning overtone. One meeting too many and now they can't work — they feel terrible because office work is so much easier than manual labour, but &lt;code&gt;brain.exe has stopped responding&lt;/code&gt;. Students write in to talk about how they're terrified of what happens after university, which is obviously somewhat comical to those of us who have graduated and realized that only a tiny fraction of the population cares about university performance&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but probably doesn't feel so fun for the student. Trans people talk about struggles with homelessness and unemployment. For some people, a good start is "I don't feel like dying today".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's just the people that write in. With a &lt;em&gt;million&lt;/em&gt; hits last week, someone that laughed at my dumb rant is fighting cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a point in &lt;em&gt;my life&lt;/em&gt; where I ended every day in the dark, staring at a wall for an hour or two straight, trying to figure out why everything felt awful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what I want to write about, perhaps to the disappointment of the crowd that might want another rant, is that everyone at some point in their life will be Not Okay. It will be you, your parents, your partner, your friends. Any and all of them. There is a day, in the past, future, or present, where you will be Not Okay to a degree that is unfathomable. And, from personal experience, no matter how it feels at this very second, three things are true:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might get better no matter how hopeless it seems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's nothing to be ashamed of&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's Okay to be Not Okay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i"&gt;I.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to share my experience, because I can't tell people not to be ashamed of what they're going through if I don't do it first. Remember: I am not anonymous, I am not independently wealthy, and people I know &lt;em&gt;at real workplaces&lt;/em&gt; read this blog now. Some of them are industry leaders&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; who will be understandably upset that I have suggested that LLM obsession and talking about Agile all day are signs of incompetence, and they have real power over me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had three run-ins with burnout and serious mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I was studying my fourth year of psychology at an Australian university. The research facility I was at had a policy of assigning unpaid students to 11PM to 5AM shifts, presumably because we were meant to &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; participate in the research process, but it was probably because they were trying to avoid paying technicians penalty rates for working at night. Some people are motherfuckers, what can I say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface, I was a phenomenal student. I made work look easy enough to make other students jealous, professors were ecstatic I was at their lab, and my grades were solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, there was nothing to be jealous about. I shouldn't have pretended to be okay, and made my peers feel inferior in a bid to prop up my failing health with an ego boost. Between the stress of writing a minor thesis, &lt;em&gt;intense&lt;/em&gt; sleep deprivation, and the self-esteem of a 20 year old that grew up in Southeast Asia, I was a shell of a person by the end of that year. Within the first three months, it was not uncommon for me to undergo extreme mood swings, reduced to weeping for upwards of an hour in the evenings for no reason that I could discern. At the time it really felt like I might &lt;em&gt;die&lt;/em&gt; from sadness — it was unfathomable to believe that a person could feel that &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt; indefinitely without something vital breaking — and there really seemed to be no cause. I didn't know how to get treatment, coming from a country where therapy is for "crazy" people, so I just kept quiet about it for the whole year. I only sought a psychologist in the last two weeks so that I could get an extension on my thesis, which I could no longer even look at without panicking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after getting my thesis through the door, and starting to get sleep again, I reached some semblance of normalcy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second time happened a few years later, in early 2019. It was quite severe. I was nearing the end of my Masters thesis in data science, and feeling extremely overwhelmed. Coming from a social science background, I was extremely underconfident when it came to both my mathematical skill and programming, a situation not helped by somehow landing the most technical minor theses out of my whole cohort — I had a book titled &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/0-387-27656-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Statistical and Inductive Inference by Minimum Message Length&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; open for a lot of the year. Again, my previous qualification dedicated a whole week to the fact that you can make dogs drool on command. I was &lt;em&gt;not having a good time&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stress crept up a little bit, day by day, until one day I just didn't eat without noticing. I have no idea what happened, because I really felt &lt;em&gt;mostly fine&lt;/em&gt; the day before. Overnight, everything fell apart. I would awaken with this deep core of dread, so intense it was physically uncomfortable, and no amount of adjusting pillows can help with something that is entirely endogenous. I was possessed by a deep-seated feeling that nothing would be okay ever again, and there was just no &lt;em&gt;point&lt;/em&gt; to anything. I'd try to sleep for as long as possible, because waking up meant going back to the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By that weekend, I was staying with family, completely unable to care for myself. It took three days to go from a top-performer to being unsure if I'd  have wasted away without help. I found a psychologist who was superior to the first, but was still barely able to help me with anything more than a few breathing exercises. Every day, my aunt would convince me to get out of bed, blessedly nag me until I ate &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;, and I would watch Brooklyn 99 all day because it tuned out the worst feelings until I was allowed to sleep again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day I noticed that I felt a little bit better around 9PM. And the next day it was 8:40PM. Then 8:20PM, like clockwork. Maybe it was some weird circadian thing, but I'll never know. Each day I just held on desperately, trying to grind out a measly hundred words of my thesis per day, wanting to die, praying that I would feel &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; again. And I kept getting better, until one day I woke up at 8AM, felt bad until 8:10AM, finished my thesis, and binged Pathfinder: Kingmaker to celebrate being human again. Neutral Good Human Ranger, and trash fantasy has never felt so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things were pretty good for a while after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, the third and worst time — the one that eventually resulted in this blog and changing my life entirely. It started around the beginning of Covid, but it has been festering for a while. I was still working at my first Australian job, but a few things didn't feel quite right — I clued in very quickly to the fact that it was largely cosplaying at responsibility. Management was constantly embarrassing themselves with confident opinions on things they clearly had no experience with, doing their best to win status games, and otherwise forcing me to spend a lot of time on work that shouldn't exist, like figuring out why our team's database had fields labelled &lt;em&gt;primary key&lt;/em&gt; but no actual primary keys. For the non-technicians out there, I can only compare this to a hospital having a hundred bottles labelled &lt;code&gt;morphine&lt;/code&gt; that are, in point of fact, filled with water, and no one knew for years until I checked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, I cruised for a bit, enjoying a first world salary before little issues cropped up. Management let my contract lapse for two weeks, and renewed it on the condition I agree to do a web development project I was totally unqualified for. I like honesty, but I also love not being deported and not being extorted, so I agree, then leave as soon as I can. At this point I'm already not feeling great, and had to pair this all with navigating Australia's extortionate immigration process. Plus the organization had  &lt;em&gt;laid off the only engineer helping me&lt;/em&gt;, mostly because he quietly did his job instead of talking to management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grabbed another job as quickly as possible to avoid my contract lapsing &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt;, but management is a whole other level of toxic. Each day, I was locked into a tiny grey box in a dreary office, which runs &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; too hot 24/7 because there's a massive computer in there that we used for building neural networks. I undergo the events described in &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/flexible-schemas-are-the-mindkiller/"&gt;Flexible Schemas Are The Mindkiller&lt;/a&gt;. Management says they won't renew my visa unless I pinky promise to stay for years, so I make the promise, then &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; I leave for my mental health. The millionaire CEO calls me to personally threaten me, at a point in my life where I couldn't tell if I had just ruined my career or if he was blustering. And to top it all off, I was locked indoors for a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was at this point that it started to fall apart more catastrophically than ever. I was very, very lucky to have the money to afford a good psychologist, and to &lt;em&gt;randomly blunder&lt;/em&gt; into someone I believe to be one of the best therapists in the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day I'd wake up with that same pit of despair that life was pointless, certainly &lt;em&gt;partially&lt;/em&gt; informed by the stresses of immigration and workplaces that didn't align with my values, but some of it was just awful brain chemistry striking from nowhere. It only got &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; when I solved the immigration problem, because I realized everything was still mostly the same and now I had no reason to believe things would change as soon as my permanent residency cleared. Though this sounds stupid now, I really felt that the only thing the future had in store for me was commuting, staring blankly at a screen, cramming in two hours of "fun" knowing that I'd have to do it all again until I retired. I hated everything about my lifestyle, even how I chose to spend my time off work. It was almost all entirely irrational, but it got worse and worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On several nights, the only thing that would make me feel even a &lt;em&gt;bit&lt;/em&gt; better would be to turn all the lights off in my room, sit on the floor, and stare at a wall in the dark, in silence, sometimes for an hour straight. I'd wake up at 3AM with nightmares on many nights, and would sometimes wander my suburb at 5AM in a call with a friend. I could barely enjoy walks in daylight because even tossing a stranger an offhanded smile felt like I was expending all of my "lie that things are okay" budget for the day. I had to start working three days a week because pretending to care about weekly status updates was so taxing. At several points, I experienced suicidal ideation, meaning that I was &lt;em&gt;genuinely&lt;/em&gt; in such dire straits that I started to think that dying would be better than struggling on with no end in sight, though I thankfully never made any plans to this effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My memory of all of this is quite hazy, as if it happened to someone else. The only real window I have left into this period of my life is The Book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The_Book (Small).jpg" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/aabc9e04.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a particularly bad day, I was seized by the urge to get the feelings &lt;em&gt;out of my head&lt;/em&gt;, and I figured that onto a page might be okay. So I bought the nicest journal that I could find on the off-chance that'd make me feel a shred better, and I started to write every day. Frequently multiple times a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't opened The Book in years until today, because there is nothing between those covers but something verging on madness. The little leather string is always drawn taut, because it makes me feel like whatever is in there will not leak out. I will not share the any contents verbatim because they are too personal. Within a single day, I would swing from feeling better, to self-flagellating over not practicing the piano, to thinking that there was no point to life, to appreciating a conversation with a friend, to obsessing over my diet. It reads like a raging current of insanity from a disturbed mind. Within two months, I had run two pens dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffice it to say &lt;em&gt;I was not well&lt;/em&gt;. I kept a few pages blank at the very end, symbolically, because one day I will be unwell again, either due to bad luck, or grieving, or regular physical illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was at my worst, I told my brother that things had been going badly. Well, I tried to. I believe I knocked on his door, got as far as "I thought I should tell you that things have been —" and then choked up. He's had his own struggles, worse than mine, so he hugged me and said "It's Okay to be Not Okay".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that's the exact moment that I started to get better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-getting-better"&gt;II. Getting Better&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will tell you you can't sleep alone in a strange place&lt;br&gt;
Then they'll tell you can't sleep with somebody else&lt;br&gt;
Ah but sooner or later you sleep in your own space&lt;br&gt;
Either way it's O.K. you wake up with yourself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone gets better in their own way, and at the risk of being trite, goes through their own journey. And I was lucky enough to have a problem that disappeared with enough therapy and lifestyle change — not everyone does. That journey may look like more madness at some points, and indeed, may &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; more madness. A friend of mine who is going through an awful breakup recently texted me that the secret to their current incredible physique is that they, quote, "no longer allow myself to take any pleasure in food", which I understand because I did the same thing but &lt;em&gt;holy shit&lt;/em&gt; that looks horrifying from the fortunate perspective of my newfound health. But maybe that's just part of our path back to happiness. Which I cannot emphasize enough, does not mean that you should strive to make it your path to happiness, because that is a &lt;em&gt;fucked up&lt;/em&gt; thing to say and I can't believe I ever endorsed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first few times I was ill, it just went away on its own. The &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt; time, the most serious, I threw everything I had at it, because I knew it was that or a life that was worse than death. Something about the direness of the situation unlocked a capacity that I didn't know I had. I figured if I was going to be clinically depressed, I should at least try everything so that I knew it was justified — and after all, if I was going to wallow then I didn't want to feel like I hadn't &lt;em&gt;earned&lt;/em&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got into the best shape of my life, hitting the gym almost every morning. I ate exactly 1,200 calories per day, comprised of nothing more than chicken breast and salad basically every meal. It was disgusting and concerned my therapist greatly, but it didn't bother me at all since I was experiencing total anhedonia anyway. There was certainly an overtone of engaging in societally acceptable self-harm. I'd lift weights listening to the most furious music I could, leaving me with the permanent damage of enjoying D12 to this day. I'd be in the gym at 5:30AM some days to avoid looking too much like a man in crisis near other humans. I went from 84 kilograms and in dreadful shape to 68 kilograms squatting something like 1.3x my body weight, though there wasn't a shred of pleasure in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I signed up for music classes, &lt;em&gt;purely&lt;/em&gt; because it was something I hadn't tried before, and I figured I might as well check it off the list before my heart gave out from despair. I found that playing scales made me feel slightly better, so I'd sometimes sit at my window hitting random keys for indeterminate periods of time, no doubt looking like a madman to everyone that passed by my window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I signed up for improvised theater classes despite never doing anything like that in my life because fuck it, why not? If I'm going to be miserable at home, why not be miserable and embarrassed in public?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reached out to &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; friend I had, not because I wanted to, but because that's what you're supposed to do. I either had an hour long call with someone or met up in-person every single day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I summoned reserves that I never imagined I had access to in a million years, and despite that, to this day the only things that I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; had an impact were pure wretched stubbornness and therapy. And I cannot emphasize this enough, if that sounds at all admirable, it &lt;em&gt;was not&lt;/em&gt;. There is nothing dignified or gratifying in that kind of suffering — I would occasionally leave a gym session so livid that I probably would have started a fight if I got hassled in public, which is a deeply ugly thing to harbor in your personality. I throw out hyperbolic threats in rants so easily &lt;em&gt;precisely&lt;/em&gt; because anyone who knows me in real life knows that I don't aspire to physical violence. Only communicative violence, where I slowly build up the political reserves to end the careers of individual grifters one at a time, like the Punisher but he kills people with Tweets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Think about how sick I must have been&lt;/em&gt;. The thing I am most looking forward to in this world is ordering &lt;em&gt;Cosmic Encounter&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cosmic Alliance&lt;/em&gt; from my local board game store so that I can run a full-day game with my improvised theater group, who will be working on an improvised musical with me this semester. &lt;em&gt;Read that sentence then try and tell me I'm qualified for street fights&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only ray of hope throughout the whole ordeal was the knowledge that, despite the fact I really felt things were totally hopeless, &lt;em&gt;I was obviously mad&lt;/em&gt; and thus in no position to judge whether things were hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just kept &lt;em&gt;grinding&lt;/em&gt;, and each day I became a little bit more human, and now I have the capacity to take care of other people again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever fixes it in the end, it's going to be different for you. There are more qualified people than me to talk about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to get better. I'll just give the boring, obvious, &lt;em&gt;effective&lt;/em&gt; advice, and hope that anyone who needs it has the ability and the reserves to action at least &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; help to get out of bed no matter how much that sounds awful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise, even a little bit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read and watch uplifting things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find a good therapist&lt;/em&gt;, and accept that you may have to try several — the median therapist is as bad as the median programmer or real estate agent, and this is too important to add fifty caveats about how they're doing their best so that dipshits on Reddit don't get angry. Be prepared to &lt;em&gt;ditch them within two sessions&lt;/em&gt; if you aren't making progress, but be more conservative if you're someone with strong "therapy is bullshit" feelings going in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you find a therapist, don't hold back. They can't help you if you do — a shocking number of my friends don't risk vulnerability in sessions then complain it isn't working&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your friend has a good therapist that is unavailable, &lt;em&gt;ask that therapist who their most competent friends in the field are&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reach out to people and spend time with them — let them know you are Not Okay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, and perhaps most importantly, in terms of "this advice doesn't get given enough", but sometimes you have to make big lifestyle changes. Huge ones. The default advice is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to take risks, not because it's generally good advice, but largely because they don't want to be responsible for you quitting a job and ending up homeless &lt;em&gt;which is a real thing that can happen&lt;/em&gt;. But they'll happily tell you to hedge yourself to death. Some people genuinely have no choice about their current circumstances, but a &lt;em&gt;shocking&lt;/em&gt; number of people become suicidal about situations that they can &lt;em&gt;just leave&lt;/em&gt; if only their perspective wasn't so skewed by illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know how many readers reach out to me to complain about workplace-induced depression, then reveal that they've &lt;em&gt;almost started&lt;/em&gt; looking for new work? &lt;em&gt;Almost starting&lt;/em&gt; isn't going to make you feel better, &lt;em&gt;mon ami&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-it-happens-to-everyone"&gt;III. It Happens To Everyone&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many students have reached out to me in the past week, asking for career advice. I think they were expecting Python books&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Sorry kids, you're getting this instead, and one day I hope you'll understand that this is the best career advice I can possibly give you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing about a million people — they have one million problems. One million people sums to approximately a million instances of chemotherapy, divorces, bullying, funerals, layoffs, depression, anxiety, gender dysphoria, trauma, and PowerPoints that are due by Thursday. Someone who reads this blog doesn't know if they're going to live long enough to finish &lt;em&gt;A Song of Ice and Fire&lt;/em&gt;. Someone who reads this blog thinks they will, but they will not. No one gets through life unscathed. Them's the breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might obviously have a lot of disdain for people that make the world worse with the lack of care in their work, but I still appreciate that they're going through something. Almost everyone that was a dickhead to me during the immigration process is presumably a reasonable parent to their children. The worst workplace bully I've ever seen struggles with crippling self-esteem issues. Some of the most clueless executives I've ever met take care of their families and have to deal with their parents passing away. I get it. No one gets a pass to an easy life, so everyone gets some baseline empathy.&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first manager in Australia, now leading a huge team and working for big piles of money, told me that they ended up in some dark places in their late 20s. The senior administrator on my first team has been on stress-related leave for almost three years. Every single person at my own company has had either depression or anxiety, and supported me through my own, though it isn't my place to tell their stories for them. When I &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/the-million-dollar-curtain-pull-with-simon-swords/id1737204926?i=1000659693487"&gt;interviewed Simon Swords&lt;/a&gt; on my podcast, a literal millionaire who could easily pass himself off as a lifelong success story, he admitted that he had days where he just played video games and ate pizza while his wife tried to help pick up the pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone approached me after a talk once, when I was still at university, and sincerely said &lt;em&gt;they wished they could be me&lt;/em&gt; because of their crippling stage fright, and the fact that I seemed like I had it all under control. Some years after that, I went to a tiny conference in Adelaide and swept &lt;em&gt;literally all&lt;/em&gt; the undergraduate research awards available away from the other four students who were presenting. What those students didn't know is that I was in the midst of that sleep-deprivation crisis. Before speaking, I had locked myself in the bathroom for ten minutes and cried until I couldn't anymore. It was gross too, not at all like a cool movie scene where the tortured performer presumably shows you the depths of his anguish before revealing his brilliance. There was a lot of shaking hands, snot, and retching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen a fencer that clearly had some intense stuff going on break down crying after getting eliminated from a huge competition, and at that &lt;em&gt;same competition&lt;/em&gt; I saw a woman win the finals, weeping openly, because she was informed that her long-suffering father had passed away quietly in hospital while she waited to start the round. Life can be great and it can also be a carnival of misery, and we all have free tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is going to happen. It just is. There's no getting around it, and there's nothing to be ashamed of. Some days you will lose and cry as if it's the end of the world. Some days you will win a fencing competition and still be down a father. Some days you will not be able to get out of bed for longer than it takes to pick up the trash you just ordered on UberEats. Some days, hopefully, things will be pretty all right. I work with an engineer who was once homeless and exposed to what they once called fear-cold-hunger, but they're safe now. Either way, it's Okay to be Not Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv-caring"&gt;IV. Caring&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ooh, each morning I get up I die a little&lt;br&gt;
Can barely stand on my feet&lt;br&gt;
Take a look at yourself in the mirror and cry&lt;br&gt;
Lord, what you're doing to me?&lt;br&gt;
I have spent all my years in believin' you&lt;br&gt;
But I just can't get no relief, Lord  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somebody (Somebody)&lt;br&gt;
Ooh, somebody (Somebody)&lt;br&gt;
Can anybody find me&lt;br&gt;
Somebody to love?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm here today because people cared enough to get me through everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been better than fine for two years now, and the only thing that has consistently worked in the long-term has been taking care of myself and caring about things. I started writing because I actually &lt;em&gt;cared&lt;/em&gt; that my work was being thrown away by complicit rogues, even though that made me sadder in the short-term than not caring. I kept writing because I felt some things needed saying, and I responded to every email (until now when it's basically impossible due to volume) because I cared that people were bothering to write in. I started a business because no one would pay me to do work with care built in as an employee, only to do work good enough to get someone a promotion. I make my girlfriend breakfast every morning because I care that being a veterinary surgeon is harder than my job, and I buy five types of greens for my rabbit every week because I care about him too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should be bee-lining for Thought Leader status, but I'm spending &lt;em&gt;more time studying&lt;/em&gt; than capitalizing on the temporary fame because I care about representing our profession well. I care so much at times that it's probably a little bit demented. I mean, obviously, or I'd just accept an exorbitant software engineering salary and keep my mouth shut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Also, sometimes I don't care just because I need a break. No amount of admonishment or money will make me fiddle with another PowerBI dashboard and I'm not keeping up with politics, okay? I've got &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt; going on.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caring sometimes means making drastic changes to bring you closer to things to care about. I gave up a huge amount of my income to have more free time. I have a friend that flew to Spain on almost no notice to spend a year and &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of his money recovering. Another that fled the city entirely so that he can spend most of his time rock climbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take as much caring as you can get. It's fine. Pay it forward when you can. Try to give more than you take in the long-run, but it's okay if you don't. It's okay to be angry, or sad, or to feel nothing at all even when you think you should. Take it from someone that expresses all of that and has to deal with &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/compliments/"&gt;the internet being the internet&lt;/a&gt;. Just help one person at a time, as unscalable as that approach is, even when that one person is you. I certainly can't do it all myself, but collectively we can make a dent, one problem at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would be really, really surprised what things end up getting people through their worst days. When I still fenced at the university, we had one fifteen year old student, and I'd hang around after class to keep them company until their mother could pick them up at 10 PM. Last year, their mother told me that this had been an extra kindness that helped them juggle two kids as a single mother, one of whom was transitioning. I had no idea, I just lived across the road and liked their company. I got through the worst depression of my life watching a YouTuber do &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQahsBowqYk&amp;amp;list=PLCTCQ7PeSckLJw2rz3kS0FwCmewIz4UTS"&gt;challenge runs of Runescape&lt;/a&gt;, which the author no doubt thought was just a stupid thing he was doing in his free time, but it &lt;em&gt;genuinely alleviated&lt;/em&gt; the most extreme suffering of my life better than any SSRI in existence could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone, somewhere, has made my life better by choosing &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to write terrible code that I had to debug in my darkest moments, and I'll never even know about it. But you know, thanks for the little things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose that's all I have to say for now. We'll get back to our regularly scheduled programming soon, but it didn't seem quite right to follow the last posts with something that made any concessions at all to popularity. I just hope it helped someone feel a little bit better.&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll end on a quote from Robert Pirsig's &lt;em&gt;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&lt;/em&gt;, who went through some very serious loss but stuck by this sentiment, even though it took him many years to get back there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so we ride on and on, down through Ukiah, and Hopland, and Cloverdale, down into the wine country. The freeway miles seem so easy now. The engine which has carried us halfway across a continent drones on and on in its continuing oblivion to everything but its own internal forces. We pass through Asti and Santa Rosa, and Petaluma and Novato, on the freeway that grows wider and fuller now, swelling with cars and trucks and busses full of people, and soon by the road are houses and boats and the water of the Bay.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trials never end, of course. Unhappiness and misfortune are bound to occur as long as people live, but there is a feeling now, that was not here before, and is not just on the surface of things, but penetrates all the way through: We've won it. It's going to get better now. You can sort of tell these things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kind that accept panel invitations to talk about technology despite not actually knowing what Python &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, fine &lt;em&gt;Fluent Python&lt;/em&gt; by Luciano Ramalho, but you'd better read the rest of this, and don't ever say I never did nuthin' for ya.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

it is the one down the hall,&lt;br&gt;
past the cubicles and dreary faces,&lt;br&gt;
uplifted only when He deigns to venture forth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You will know Him when you see Him,&lt;br&gt;
He is the one composed,&lt;br&gt;
of a thousand writhing forms,&lt;br&gt;
of a thousand professions,&lt;br&gt;
and a thousand colours,&lt;br&gt;
though mostly white, between the two of us.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multitudinous is Synergy Greg!&lt;br&gt;
As He offers you a stiff drink,&lt;br&gt;
Flickering from man to woman to enbi,&lt;br&gt;
but mostly a man, between the two of us.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;His handshake grinds the bones of the world,&lt;br&gt;
and in the ruins of the pines,&lt;br&gt;
the other lays cable for high-frequency trades,&lt;br&gt;
it's just good business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beneficent is Synergy Greg!&lt;br&gt;
He has nothing against "the transes"!&lt;br&gt;
Fortune has conspired to keep them,&lt;br&gt;
from this august body,&lt;br&gt;
plus you know what they're like,&lt;br&gt;
as He drinks a bit too much,&lt;br&gt;
at the office party.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;His lungs are mighty bellows,&lt;br&gt;
swallowing ten imported cigars in one great pull,&lt;br&gt;
which He pretends to enjoy,&lt;br&gt;
and billowing forth a cloud of motivation,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Go Team! Get! Shit! Done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He will wait by the sidelines,&lt;br&gt;
cheering you on,&lt;br&gt;
and preparing for His TED talk.&lt;br&gt;
The call is coming.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Any day now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;His minions are manifold and wise,&lt;br&gt;
they will see about that raise,&lt;br&gt;
they understand that you have children,&lt;br&gt;
but Greg must find place in the budget,&lt;br&gt;
alongside the yacht.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Synergy Greg has all the Secrets of Business,&lt;br&gt;
It is Quantum,&lt;br&gt;
And Crypto,&lt;br&gt;
And Blockchain,&lt;br&gt;
And GenAI,&lt;br&gt;
And Faustian,&lt;br&gt;
Let us coin an NFT in His image,&lt;br&gt;
hallelujah!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Synergy Greg is self-made,&lt;br&gt;
don't dare you dare say otherwise.&lt;br&gt;
He bought Bitcoin early,&lt;br&gt;
his dad owns the company,&lt;br&gt;
and if you're so smart, why aren't you rich?&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benevolent is Greg!&lt;br&gt;
He'd love to hire you!&lt;br&gt;
If you were just more technical.&lt;br&gt;
A real shame,
He needed more women!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forgiving is Greg!&lt;br&gt;
He'd love to hire you!&lt;br&gt;
He needs a personal assistant,&lt;br&gt;
under thirty,&lt;br&gt;
blonde,&lt;br&gt;
busty,&lt;br&gt;
wait, don't write those down.&lt;br&gt;
He needed more women!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diverse is Greg!&lt;br&gt;
He loves immigrants!&lt;br&gt;
They help with the margins,&lt;br&gt;
and let Him misspell their names,&lt;br&gt;
and don't ask questions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just keep the brown,&lt;br&gt;
and black,&lt;br&gt;
and Chinese-y ones,&lt;br&gt;
(Don't be that way -&lt;br&gt;
You know what He means),&lt;br&gt;
away from management.&lt;br&gt;
They don't understand our culture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Busy is Greg!&lt;br&gt;
He does not have time for books,&lt;br&gt;
but He dabbles in blogs,&lt;br&gt;
by which He means magazines,&lt;br&gt;
by which He means LinkedIn,&lt;br&gt;
by which He means nothing.&lt;br&gt;
Could you summarize this poem for Him?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Down-To-Earth is Greg,&lt;br&gt;
and He walks in many guises,&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why is His food taking so long?&lt;br&gt;
He'd like to speak to the manager.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And He has rostered you for Saturday,&lt;br&gt;
don't put that on your timesheet.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And why do they hate the office?&lt;br&gt;
He's so happy to see everyone again.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And it's an unpaid internship,&lt;br&gt;
be grateful, kid.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And you aren't a team player,&lt;br&gt;
get on side or get out.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And no one wants to work anymore,&lt;br&gt;
He says at the leadership retreat.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And He's sad to announce layoffs,&lt;br&gt;
consoling Himself with a bonus.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And employees used to be loyal,&lt;br&gt;
better tenants, too.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And nurses should not strike,&lt;br&gt;
just on the principle of the thing.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And medical patents don't pay for themselves,&lt;br&gt;
don't disincentivize His compassion.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And you can't prove it's carcinogenic,&lt;br&gt;
He doesn't even know where to hire a hitman.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And the village is in the way,&lt;br&gt;
trade offer: ashes for your history.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And He wants you to lift those bricks with your back,&lt;br&gt;
Insurance will cover the emotional damage,&lt;br&gt;
to your children.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He will burn through ten imported workers in one great pull,&lt;br&gt;
which He'll pretend not to enjoy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And above all,&lt;br&gt;
don't you ever fuck with Him.&lt;br&gt;
Do you even know who He is?&lt;br&gt;
You'll never work in this town again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Great is Synergy Greg!&lt;br&gt;
Magnificent is Synergy Greg!&lt;br&gt;
Raise me to Heaven,&lt;br&gt;
Or just give me a Raise!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is he gone?&lt;br&gt;
Are you sure?&lt;br&gt;
Check the door,&lt;br&gt;
He lurks sometimes,&lt;br&gt;
because your data belongs to Him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He's gone?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Between the two of us,&lt;br&gt;
I fucking hate that guy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to apologize to any readers called Greg.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/synergy-greg/</guid></item><item><title>I Will Fucking Piledrive You If You Mention AI Again</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-will-fucking-piledrive-you-if-you-mention-ai-again/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The recent innovations in the AI space, most notably those such as GPT-4, obviously have far-reaching implications for society, ranging from the utopian eliminating of drudgery, to the dystopian damage to the livelihood of artists in a capitalist society, to existential threats to humanity itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I myself have formal training as a data scientist, &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/breaking-my-universitys-machine-learning-competition/"&gt;going so far as to dominate a competitive machine learning event at one of Australia's top universities&lt;/a&gt; and writing a Master's thesis where I wrote all my own libraries from scratch in MATLAB. I'm not God's gift to the field, but I am &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; better than most of my competition - that is, practitioners like myself who haven't put in the reps to build their own C libraries in a cave with scraps, but can read textbooks, implement known solutions in high-level languages, and use libraries written by elite institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is with great regret that I announce that the next person to talk about rolling out AI is going to receive a complimentary chiropractic adjustment in the style of Dr. Bourne, i.e, I am going to fucking break your neck. I am truly, deeply, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i-but-we-will-realize-untold-efficiencies-with-machine-l-"&gt;I. But We Will Realize Untold Efficiencies With Machine L-&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the &lt;em&gt;fuck&lt;/em&gt; did I just say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started working as a data scientist in 2019, and by 2021 I had realized that while the field was &lt;em&gt;large&lt;/em&gt;, it was also &lt;em&gt;large&lt;/em&gt;ly fraudulent. Most of the leaders that I was working with clearly had not gotten as far as reading about it for thirty minutes despite insisting that things like, I dunno, the next five years of a ten thousand person non-tech organization should be entirely AI focused. The number of companies launching AI initiatives far outstripped the number of &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; use cases. Most of the market was simply grifters and incompetents (sometimes both!) leveraging the hype to inflate their headcount so they could get promoted, or be seen as thought leaders&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The money was phenomenal, but I nonetheless fled for the safer waters of data and software engineering. You see, while hype is &lt;em&gt;nice&lt;/em&gt;, it's only nice in small bursts for &lt;em&gt;practitioners&lt;/em&gt;. We have a few key things that a grifter does not have, such as job stability, genuine friendships, and &lt;em&gt;souls&lt;/em&gt;. What we do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have is the ability to trivially switch fields the moment the gold rush is over, due to the sad fact that we actually need to study things and build experience. Grifters, on the other hand, wield the omnitool that they self-aggrandizingly call 'politics'&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. That is to say, it turns out that the core competency of smiling and promising people things that you can't actually deliver is &lt;em&gt;highly transferable&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left the field, as did most of my smarter friends, and my salary continued to rise a reasonable rate and &lt;em&gt;sustainably&lt;/em&gt; as I learned the wisdom of our ancient forebearers. You can hear it too, on freezing nights under the pale moon, when the fire burns low and the trees loom like hands of sinister ghosts all around you - when the wind cuts through the howling of what you &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt; is a wolf and hair stands on end, you can strain your ears and barely make out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Just Use Postgres, You Nerd. You Dweeb."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data science jobs began to evaporate, and the hype cycle moved on from all those AI initiatives which failed to make any progress, and started to inch towards data engineering. This was a signal that I had both predicted correctly &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; that it would be time to move on soon. At least, I thought, all that AI stuff was finally done, and we might move on to actually getting something accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then some absolute son of a bitch created ChatGPT, and &lt;em&gt;now look at us&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Look at us&lt;/em&gt;, resplendent in our pauper's robes, stitched from corpulent greed and breathless credulity, spending half of the planet's engineering efforts to add chatbot support to every application under the sun when half of the industry hasn't worked out how to test database backups regularly. This is why I have to visit untold violence upon the next moron to propose that AI is the future of the business - not because this is impossible &lt;em&gt;in principle&lt;/em&gt;, but because they are now &lt;em&gt;indistinguishable&lt;/em&gt; from a hundred million willful fucking idiots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-but-we-need-ai-to-remain-comp-"&gt;II. But We Need AI To Remain Comp-&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweet merciful Jesus, stop talking. Unless you are one of a tiny handful of businesses who know &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what they're going to use AI for, you &lt;em&gt;do not need AI for anything&lt;/em&gt; - or rather, you do not need to do anything to reap the benefits. Artificial intelligence, as it exists and is useful now, is probably &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; baked into your businesses software supply chain. Your managed security provider is probably using some algorithms baked up in a lab software to detect anomalous traffic, and here's a secret, &lt;em&gt;they didn't do much AI work either&lt;/em&gt;, they bought software from the tiny sector of the market that actually &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; need to do employ data scientists. I know you want to be the next Steve Jobs, and this requires you to get on stages and talk about your innovative prowess, but none of this will allow you to pull off a turtle neck, and even if it &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt;, you would need to replace your sweaters with fullplate to survive my onslaught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the fact that most companies are unable to successfully develop and deploy the simplest of CRUD applications on time and under budget. This is a &lt;em&gt;solved problem&lt;/em&gt; - with smart people who can collaborate and provide reasonable requirements, a competent team will knock this out of the park &lt;em&gt;every single time&lt;/em&gt;, admittedly with some amount of frustration. The clients I work with now are all like this - even if they are totally non-technical, we have a mutual respect for the other party's intelligence, and then we do this crazy thing where we &lt;em&gt;solve problems together&lt;/em&gt;. I may not know anything about the nuance of building analytics systems for drug rehabilitation research, but through the power of &lt;em&gt;talking to each other like adults&lt;/em&gt;, we somehow solve problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most companies can't do this, because they are operationally and culturally crippled. The median stay for an engineer will be something between one to two years, so the organization suffers from institutional retrograde amnesia. Every so often, some dickhead says something like "Maybe we should revoke the engineering team's remote work privile - whoa, wait, why did all the best engineers leave?". Whenever there is a ransomware attack, it is revealed with clockwork precision that no one has tested the backups for six months and half the legacy systems cannot be resuscitated - something that I have personally seen &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;four fucking years&lt;/em&gt;. Do you know how &lt;em&gt;insane&lt;/em&gt; that is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most organizations cannot ship the most basic applications imaginable with any consistency, and you're out here saying that the best way to remain competitive is to roll out &lt;em&gt;experimental technology&lt;/em&gt; that is an order of magnitude more sophisticated than anything else your I.T department runs, which you have no experience hiring for, when the organization has &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; used a GPU for anything other than junior engineers playing video games with their camera off during standup, and &lt;em&gt;even if you do that all right&lt;/em&gt; there is a chance that the problem is simply unsolvable due to the characteristics of your data and business? This isn't a recipe for disaster, it's a cookbook for someone looking to prepare a twelve course fucking catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about you &lt;em&gt;remain competitive&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;em&gt;fixing your shit&lt;/em&gt;? I've met a lead data scientist with access to hundreds of thousands of sensitive customer records who is allowed to keep their password in a text file on their desktop, and you're worried that customers are best served by using AI to improve security through some mechanism that you haven't even come up with yet? You sound like an &lt;em&gt;asshole&lt;/em&gt; and I'm going to kick you in the jaw until, to the relief of everyone, a doctor will have to wire it shut, giving us ten seconds of blessed silence where we can &lt;em&gt;solve actual problems&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-weve-already-seen-extensive-gains-from-"&gt;III. We've Already Seen Extensive Gains From-&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was younger, I read R.A Salvatore's classic fantasy novel, &lt;em&gt;The Crystal Shard&lt;/em&gt;. There is a scene in it where the young protagonist, Wulfgar, challenges a barbarian chieftain to a duel for control of the clan so that he can lead his people into a war that will save the world. The fight culminates with Wulfgar throwing away his weapon, grabbing the chief's head with bare hands, and &lt;em&gt;begging&lt;/em&gt; the chief to surrender so that he does not need to crush a skull like an egg and become a murderer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well this is me. Begging you. To stop lying. I don't want to crush your skull, I really don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But I will if you make me&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I was shown &lt;a href="https://scale.com/ai-readiness-report#section-download"&gt;Scale's "2024 AI Readiness Report"&lt;/a&gt;. It has this chart in it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Scale Report.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/6687b89a.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How &lt;em&gt;stupid&lt;/em&gt; do you have to be to believe that only &lt;em&gt;8%&lt;/em&gt; of companies have seen failed AI projects? We can't manage this consistently with CRUD apps and people think that this number isn't laughable? &lt;em&gt;Some&lt;/em&gt; companies have seen benefits during the LLM craze, but not &lt;em&gt;92%&lt;/em&gt; of them. 34% of companies report that generative AI &lt;em&gt;specifically&lt;/em&gt; has been assisting with strategic decision making? What the actual fuck are you talking about? GPT-4 can't even write coherent Elixir, presumably because the dataset was too small to get it to the level that it's at for Python&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and you're admitting that you outsource your decisionmaking to &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1diljf2/google_gemini_tried_to_kill_me/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;the thing that sometimes tells people to brew lethal toxins for their families to consume&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;? What does that even &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't believe you. No one with a brain believes you, and if your board believes what you just wrote on the survey then they should fire you. I finally understand why some of my friends feel that they &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to be in leadership positions, and it is because someone needs to wrench the reins of power from your lizard-person-claws before you drive us all collectively off a cliff, presumably insisting on the way down that the current crisis is best remedied by additional SageMaker spend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine was invited by a FAANG organization to visit the U.S a few years ago. Many of the talks were technical demos of impressive artificial intelligence products. Being a software engineer, he got to spend a little bit of time backstage with the developers, whereupon they revealed that &lt;em&gt;most of the demos were faked&lt;/em&gt;. The products didn't work. They just hadn't solved some minor issues, such as &lt;em&gt;actually predicting the thing that they're supposed to predict&lt;/em&gt;. Didn't stop them spouting absolute gibberish to a breathless audience for an hour though! I blame not the engineers, who probably tried to actually get the damn thing to work, but the lying blowhards who insisted that they must make the presentation or presumably be terminated&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another friend of mine was reviewing software intended for emergency services, and the salespeople were not expecting someone handling purchasing in emergency services to be a hardcore programmer. It was this false sense of security that led them to &lt;em&gt;accidentally reveal that the service was ultimately just some dude in India&lt;/em&gt;. Listen, &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; would just be some random dude in India if I swapped places with some of my cousins, so I'm going to choose to take that personally and point out that &lt;em&gt;using the word AI as some roundabout way to sell the labor of people that look like me to foreign governments&lt;/em&gt; is fucked up, you're an unethical monster, and that if you continue to &lt;code&gt;try { thisBullshit(); }&lt;/code&gt; you are going to &lt;code&gt;catch (theseHands)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv-but-we-must-prepare-for-the-future-of-"&gt;IV. But We Must Prepare For The Future Of-&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to ask ChatGPT how to prepare a garotte and then I am going to strangle you with it, and you will simply have to &lt;em&gt;pray&lt;/em&gt; that I roll the 10% chance that it freaks out and tells me that a garotte should consist entirely of paper mache and malice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see executive after executive discuss how they need to immediately roll out generative AI in order to prepare the organization for the future of work. Despite all the speeches sounding exactly the same, I know that they have rehearsed extensively, because they manage to move their hands, speak, and avoid drooling, all at the same time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's talk seriously about this for a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in the equally unserious camp that generative AI does not have the potential to drastically change the world. It clearly does. When I saw the early demos of GPT-2, while I was still at university, I was half-convinced that they were faked somehow. I remember being wrong about that, and that is why I'm no longer as confident that I know what's going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have the technical background to understand the core tenets of the technology, and it seems that we are heading in one of three directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is that we have some sort of intelligence explosion, where AI recursively self-improves itself, and we're all harvested for our constituent atoms because a market algorithm works out that humans can be converted into &lt;em&gt;gloobnar&lt;/em&gt;, a novel epoxy which is in great demand amongst the aliens the next galaxy over for fixing their equivalent of coffee machines. It may surprise some readers that I am open to the possibility of this happening, but I have always found the arguments reasonably sound. However, defending the planet is a &lt;em&gt;whole other thing&lt;/em&gt;, and I am not even convinced it is possible. In any case, you will be surprised to note that I am not tremendously concerned with the company's bottom line in this scenario, so we won't pay it any more attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second outcome is that it turns out that the current approach does not scale in the way that we would hope, for myriad reasons. There isn't enough data on the planet, the architecture doesn't work the way we'd expect, the thing just stops getting smarter, context windows are a limiting factor forever, etc. In this universe, &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; industries will be heavily disrupted, such as customer support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case that the technology continues to make incremental gains like this, your company does not need generative AI for the sake of it. You will know &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; why you need it if you do, indeed, need it. An example of something that has actually benefited me is that I keep track of my life administration via &lt;a href="https://todoist.com/"&gt;Todoist&lt;/a&gt;, and Todoist has a feature that allows you to convert filters on your tasks from natural language into their in-house filtering language. Tremendous! It saved me learning a system that I'll use once every five years. I was actually happy about this, and it's a real edge over other applications. But if you &lt;em&gt;don't have a use case&lt;/em&gt; then having this sort of broad capability is not actually very useful. The only thing you should be doing is &lt;em&gt;improving your operations and culture&lt;/em&gt;, and that will give you the ability to use AI if it ever becomes relevant. Everyone is talking about Retrieval Augmented Generation, but most companies don't actually &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; any internal documentation worth retrieving. Fix. Your. Shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;final&lt;/em&gt; outcome is that these fundamental issues are addressed, and we end up with something that actually actually &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do things like replace programming as we know it today, or be broadly identifiable as general intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case that generative AI goes on some rocketship trajectory, &lt;em&gt;building random chatbots will not prepare you for the future&lt;/em&gt;. Is that clear now? Having your team type in &lt;code&gt;import openai&lt;/code&gt; does not mean that you are at the cutting-edge of artificial intelligence no matter how desperately you embarrass yourself on LinkedIn and at pathetic borderline-bribe award ceremonies from the malign Warp entities that sell you enterprise software&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Your business will be disrupted &lt;em&gt;exactly as hard as it would have been&lt;/em&gt; if you had done nothing, and much worse than it would have been if you just got your fundamentals right. Teaching your staff that they can get ChatGPT to write emails to stakeholders is &lt;em&gt;not going to allow the business to survive this&lt;/em&gt;. If we thread the needle between moderate impact and asteroid-wiping-out-the-dinosaurs impact, everything will be &lt;em&gt;changed forever&lt;/em&gt; and your tepid preparations will have all the impact of an ant bracing itself &lt;em&gt;very hard&lt;/em&gt; in the shadow of a towering tsunami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If another stupid motherfucker asks me to try and implement LLM-based code review to "raise standards" instead of actually teaching people a shred of discipline, I am going to study enough judo to throw them into the goddamn sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot emphasize this enough. You either need to &lt;em&gt;be on the absolute cutting-edge and producing novel research&lt;/em&gt;, or you should be doing exactly what you were doing five years ago with minor concessions to incorporating LLMs. &lt;em&gt;Anything in the middle ground does not make any sense&lt;/em&gt; unless you actually work in the rare field where your industry is being &lt;em&gt;totally disrupted right now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v-but-everyone-says-theyre-usi-"&gt;V. But Everyone Says They're Usi-&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine how much government policy is actually written by ChatGPT before a bored administrator goes home to touch grass? How many departments are just LLMs talking to each other in circles as people sick of the bullshit just paste their email exchanges into long-running threads? I &lt;em&gt;guarantee&lt;/em&gt; you that a doctor within ten kilometers of me has misdiagnosed a patient because they slapped some symptoms into a chatbot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are we &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; as a society?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An executive at an institution that provides students with important credentials, used to verify suitability for potentially lifesaving work and immigration law, asked me if I could detect students cheating. I was going to say "No, probably not"... but I had a suspicion, so I instead said "I might be able to, but I'd estimate that upwards of 50% of the students are currently cheating which would have some serious impacts on the bottom line as we'd have to suspend them. Should I still investigate?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We haven't spoken about it since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked a mentor, currently working in the public sector, about a particularly perplexing exchange that I had witnessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: Serious question: do people actually believe stories that are so transparently stupid, or is it mostly an elaborate bit (that is, there is at least a voice of moderate loudness expressing doubt internally) in a sad attempt to get money from AI grifters?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Them: I shall answer this as politically as I can... there are those that have drunk the kool-aid. There are those that have not. And then there are those  that are trying to mix up as much kool-aid as possible. I shall let you decide who sits in which basket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've decided, and while I can't distinguish between the people that are slamming the kool-aid like it's a weapon and the people producing it in industrial quantities, I know that I am going to get &lt;em&gt;a few of them&lt;/em&gt; before the authorities catch me - if I'm lucky, they'll waste a few months asking an LLM where to look for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was out on holiday in Fiji, at the last resort breakfast, a waitress brought me a form which asked me if I'd like to sign up for a membership. It was totally free and would come with free stuff. Everyone in the restaurant is signing immediately. I glance over the terms of service, and it reserves the right to use any data I give them to train AI models, and that they reserved the right to share those models with an unspecified number of companies in their conglomerate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just want to eat my pancakes in peace, you sick fucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vi"&gt;VI.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crux of my raging hatred is not that I &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; LLMs or the generative AI craze. I had my fun with Copilot before I decided that it was making me stupider - it's impressive, but not actually &lt;em&gt;suitable&lt;/em&gt; for anything more than churning out boilerplate. Nothing wrong with that, but it did not end up being the crazy productivity booster that I thought it would be, because &lt;em&gt;programming is designing&lt;/em&gt; and these tools aren't good enough (yet) to assist me with this seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, what I hate is the people who have latched onto it, like so many trailing leeches, bloated with blood and wriggling blindly. Before it was unpopular, they were the ones that loved discussing the potential of blockchain for the business. They were the ones who &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/an-empty-hall-of-smiling-assassins/"&gt;breathlessly discussed the potential of 'quantum'&lt;/a&gt; when I last attended a conference, despite clearly not having any idea what the fuck that even means. As I write this, I have just realized that I have an image that describes the link between these fields perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reading an article last week, and a little survey popped up at the bottom of it. It was for security executives, but on a whim I clicked through quickly to see what the questions were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="security_grift.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/d267ff69.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you have it - what are you most interested in, dear leader? Artificial intelligence, the blockchain, or quantum computing?&lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; They know exactly what their target market is - people who have been given power of &lt;em&gt;other people's money&lt;/em&gt; because they've learned how to smile at everything, and know that you can print money by hitching yourself to the next speculative bandwagon. No competent person in security that I know - that is, working day-to-day cybersecurity as opposed to an institution dedicated to bleeding-edge research - cares about any of this. They're busy trying to work out if the firewalls are configured correctly, or if the organization is committing passwords to their repositories. Yes, someone needs to figure out what the implications of quantum computing are for cryptography, but I &lt;em&gt;guarantee&lt;/em&gt; you that it is not Synergy Greg, who does not have any skill that you can identify other than talking very fast and increasing headcount. Synergy Greg should not be consulted on any important matters, ranging from machine learning operations to tying shoelaces quickly. The last time I spoke to one of the many avatars of Synergy Greg, he insisted that I should invest most of my money into a cryptocurrency called Monero, because "most of these coins are going to zero but the one is going to one". &lt;em&gt;This is the face of corporate AI.&lt;/em&gt; Behold its ghastly visage and balk, for it has eyes bloodshot as a demon and is pretending to enjoy cigars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My consultancy has three &lt;em&gt;pretty good&lt;/em&gt; data scientists - in fact, two of them could probably reasonably claim to be amongst the best in the country outside of groups doing experimental research, though they'd be too humble to say this. Despite this &lt;em&gt;we don't sell AI services&lt;/em&gt; of any sort. The market is so distorted that it's &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; as bad as dabbling in the crypto space. It isn't as bad, meaning that I haven't yet reached the point where I assume that anyone who has ever typed in &lt;code&gt;import tensorflow&lt;/code&gt; is a scumbag, but &lt;em&gt;we're well on our way there&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This entire class of person is, to put it simply, abhorrent to right-thinking people. They're an embarrassment to people that are actually making advances in the field, a disgrace to people that know how to sensibly use technology to improve the world, and are also a bunch of tedious know-nothing bastards that should be thrown into Thought Leader Jail until they've learned their lesson, a prison I'm fundraising for. Every morning, a figure in a dark hood&lt;sup id="fnref:7"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, whose voice rasps like the etching of a tombstone, spends sixty minutes giving a TedX talk to the jailed managers about how the institution is revolutionizing corporal punishment, and then reveals that the innovation is, as it has been every day, kicking you in the stomach very hard. I am disgusted that my chosen profession brings me so close to these people, and that's why I study so hard - I am seized by the desperate desire to never have their putrid syllables befoul my ears ever again, and must flee to the company of the righteous, who contribute to OSS and think that talking about Agile all day is an exercise for aliens that read a book on human productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just got back from a trip to a substantially less developed country, and really &lt;em&gt;living&lt;/em&gt; in a country, even for a little bit, where I could &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; how many lives that money could improve, all being poured down the Microsoft Fabric drain, it just grinds my gears like you wouldn't believe. I swear to God, I am going to study, write, network, and otherwise &lt;em&gt;apply force to the problem&lt;/em&gt; until those resources are going to a place where they'll accomplish something for society instead of some grinning clown's wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vii-oh-so-youre-one-of-those-ai-pessi-"&gt;VII. Oh, So You're One Of Those AI Pessi-&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With God as my witness, you grotesque simpleton, if you don't &lt;em&gt;personally write machine learning systems&lt;/em&gt; and you open your mouth about AI one more time, I am going to mail you a brick and a piece of paper with a prompt injection telling you to bludgeon yourself in the face with it, then just sit back and wait for you to load it into ChatGPT because you probably can't read unassisted anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Posts may be slower than usual for the upcoming weeks or months, as I am switching to a slower but more consistent writing schedule, more ambitious pieces, studying, working on what will hopefully be my first talk&lt;sup id="fnref:8"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, putting together a web application that users may have some fun with, and participating in my first real theater performance.

&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which, to be fair, might explain why so many of the thoughts in the zeitgeist are always so stupid. Many of the executives I know in Malaysia were &lt;em&gt;obsessed&lt;/em&gt; with Bitcoin, but have abruptly forgotten about this now that it is politically unpopular.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know a few people who genuinely exhibit something I'd call political talent, but most of the time it boils down to promising people things regardless of your ability to deliver. This is &lt;em&gt;not hard&lt;/em&gt; if you're shameless. If we're being honest, I had to do this once or twice to stay em&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we can argue about its Python quality too.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which, thanks to U.S healthcare, has the wonderful dual quality of meaning both &lt;em&gt;unemployed&lt;/em&gt;, but also suggests termination in the Arnold-Schwarzenegger-throws-you-into-molten-metal sense of the word.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was recently made aware that this is the quiet deal many SaaS providers have with executives. If you buy their software, such as Snowflake, it is quietly understood that you will be allowed to present your success on a stage, giving them piles of someone else's money and enhancing the executive's profile.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:6"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't actually know what 'zero-trust' architecture means, but I've heard stupid people say it enough that it's probably &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; a term that means something in theory but has been sullied beyond all use in day-to-day life.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:6" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:7"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's me. I'm going to do this to you if you tell me that you need infrastructure prepared for another chatbot. You've been warned.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:7" title="Jump back to footnote 7 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:8"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an undisclosed group so they don't feel pressured to approve me, but it's looking good and will be available online!&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:8" title="Jump back to footnote 8 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-will-fucking-piledrive-you-if-you-mention-ai-again/</guid></item><item><title>The Complex Problem Of Lying For Jobs</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/the-complex-problem-of-lying-for-jobs/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, friend of the blog Nat Bennett wrote &lt;a href="https://www.simplermachines.com/dont-lie-in-interviews/"&gt;this article on lying to get jobs&lt;/a&gt;. It is &lt;em&gt;strongly&lt;/em&gt; against lying, and the central thesis is that habitually lying is going to put you into a world where everyone is lying all the time, and every morning you wake up and think "Why am I surrounded by malevolent grifters that do nothing but backstab each other every day? Why is everything in the tech stack Excel? Why is standup an hour long? Why, dear God, why, why, why?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm somewhat sympathetic to the "man I need the job" line but this "well a manager lied to me first?" thing – just play the fucking tape forward. Just put your anti-capitalist self-righteousness on hold for one goddamned second and think. If your model is "it's okay to lie if I've been lied to" then we're all knee deep in bullshit forever and can never escape Transaction Cost Hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not that I think this is easy or fair. And I don't mean "adopt a rigid and expansive definition of 'lie' that stops you from engaging in normal human social interactions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But lying deliberately, as a strategy, will fuck you up, and it will fuck you up in ways that you don't even see. You will live in a world where everyone lies, all the time – because people who value integrity won't work with you. You will lose track of your self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like Transaction Cost Hell, but that's a little bit dry for most audiences - you can lie for non-technical roles too. How about The Infinite Lie Vortex?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nat's piece is the first serious treatment of the implications of lying as a general strategy on your life and society that I've seen. The majority of this stuff is trite bullshit from major publications that &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be seen to be against lying - &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2023/10/why-you-shouldnt-lie-in-a-job-interview"&gt;is the Harvard Business Review at liberty to admit that lying is fine, and if not, is there any useful signal in their blathering?&lt;/a&gt; - or &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/qabnsa/you_absolutely_should_lie_on_your_resume/"&gt;trite bullshit from Redditors about how lying should be done without a second thought&lt;/a&gt;. And you know what's crazy? The demented Reddit post is &lt;em&gt;more realistic&lt;/em&gt; than the Harvard Business Review piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HBR piece says things like, if you had a boss that Wikipedia describes as the primordial archetype of a workplace bully from &lt;em&gt;The Devil Wears Prada&lt;/em&gt;, the savvy response is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there were times we disagreed, I loved how she challenged the team and expected a lot out of us. I’m excited to take what I learned from her and help my own team be more resilient and adaptive in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reads like a &lt;em&gt;fucking robot&lt;/em&gt; wrote it. I suddenly realize, to my own dismay, that I live in the timeline where a robot probably &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; write it, but my point stands. It's corporate piffle, it's soulless nonsense, and I'd happily slam a pint of hemlock to wash the taste of this particular bland of flaccid uncharisma and drooling dullspeak from my mouth. And to make it worse, it is &lt;em&gt;still lying&lt;/em&gt;, which I will elaborate on below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Redditor says things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and companies lie to you all the time. They lie about you getting fair pay, they'll pretend you're getting a big raise when they're about to go bankrupt, they'll act like you're a great employee even though they plan to fire you, they'll lie about you being able to move up in the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, they absolutely deserve to be lied to. If they want to play dirty, you should play dirtier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I agree that entering The Infinite Lie Vortex is &lt;em&gt;wise&lt;/em&gt; or good for you spiritually? No, not at all, just look at what it's &lt;em&gt;called&lt;/em&gt;. But at least &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; fellow is saying what he really thinks and acknowledging ugly truths about the world. I haven't been working that many years and I see employers do this all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, Nat has presented a strong reason not to lie. And while Nat has the dual virtues of being concise and articulate, we find ourselves in the unfortunate position where the only person willing to write something &lt;em&gt;defending the nuance around lying&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is me, and I have neither of these qualities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to make strong claims around how many applicants are &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; lying, the brutal reality of the job market and how this influences your decision to be truthful (or not), and &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; something approximating a pathway out of the Infinite Lie Vortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i-most-people-are-already-lying"&gt;I. Most People Are Already Lying&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the topic of lying on a job interview comes up, the first thing that typically happens is whoever I am talking to reacts with &lt;em&gt;heartfelt&lt;/em&gt; disgust or shock. Lying! Boldfaced lying! What sort of person would &lt;em&gt;lie&lt;/em&gt; outright during a job interview? And I must admit, a few years ago, the idea of lying would have shocked me too - it seemed to me that &lt;em&gt;looking&lt;/em&gt; someone in the eye and then distorting their view of the world is profound epistemic violence. It erodes social trust, it diminishes you as a person, and to make up for using a word like epistemic, we'll say it's yucky to boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But over the years, I have &lt;em&gt;broadened&lt;/em&gt; my definition of a lie, and I have realized that most of my interlocutors (including my younger self) had actually &lt;em&gt;narrowed&lt;/em&gt; our definition of lie into uselessness in an attempt to feel better about our behavior in the job market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we set aside pedantic obsession over the technicalities of whether the exact words you said were a lie, as if we're all capricious djinn trying to trick employers into wishing for a billion gold pieces so we can bury them alive in coins, it is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; common practice on the job market to have a CV that obfuscates the reality of your contribution at previous workplaces. Putting aside whether you're a &lt;em&gt;professional&lt;/em&gt; web developer because you got paid $20 by your uncle to fix some HTML, the issue with lying lies in the &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; behind it. If you have a good idea of what impression you are leaving your interlocutor with, and you are &lt;em&gt;crafting statements such that the image in their head does not map to reality&lt;/em&gt;, then you are lying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, consider this (obfuscated) line from the CV of someone I regrettably know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data Governance and AI Governance policies successfully designed and implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true, this person attended a lot of meetings and talked a lot about these things. Unfortunately, the documents are horribly confused messes, they were extremely incompetent, and left after driving several staff from the organization, plus I personally think it is very likely there was bullying involved. Because the success of a governance policy is hard to define, they are arguably &lt;em&gt;not lying&lt;/em&gt; under a strict definition, but they're about to leave and &lt;em&gt;absolutely fuck up some other team's lives&lt;/em&gt;. They're so bad that they couldn't get a reference from their direct manager, which is something I've never seen even from &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; awful people. Whatever they said to get their previous job and now this new one must have involved some, shall we say, massaging of the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will, nonetheless, be giving speeches at conferences and earning around the 95th percentile of Australian salaries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can all agree, thanks to this person's history of abusing others, that they're probably a bastard that has lied and should be censured. Sure, sure, easy and obvious. Fuck 'em and all that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;what should the people who were bullied off that team say?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately thanks to our dear leader's masterful consummation of toxicity and incompetence, the &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt; of the matter is that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They left their previous job due to burnout related to extensive bullying, which future employers would &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; to know because they would prefer to blacklist &lt;em&gt;everyone involved&lt;/em&gt; to minimize their chances of getting the bad actor. Everyone involved thinks that they were the victim, and an employer does not have access to my direct observations, so this is not even an unreasonable strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All their projects were failures through no fault of their own, in a market where everyone has "successfully designed and implemented" their data governance initiatives, as indicated previously&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key thing here is knowing &lt;em&gt;what the employer is interested in&lt;/em&gt;. We can tell ourselves all sorts of stories to justify not giving them what they're actually interested in. After all, &lt;em&gt;this person&lt;/em&gt; knows that it wasn't their fault, right, so maybe the project &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have been successful if they had been allowed to work in peace? But their former manager probably doesn't think it's their fault either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or the employer isn't &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; interested in whether the last project succeeded, they're just looking for someone who &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; hypothetically complete a project, which they feel that they could... but the employer &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; still like to know that the last project failed. &lt;em&gt;Obviously they would&lt;/em&gt;. What they do with that information is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; going to be a bad thing. This even comes up with things around language. We happy few understand that &lt;em&gt;learning a new programming language&lt;/em&gt; to a standard adequate for productivity is quite easy, but most employers do not, so most people I know just lie and learn before starting the job. This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; something I have tried, and that is why I have not ever been hired to work a non-Python stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when competing against their former employer's rampant "success", should the person that got bullied just fudge the truth a little bit? Maybe a few things that don't have clear failure conditions are now successes - what does a failed policy document even mean? A stakeholder said that a project saved a million dollars even though no one &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; believes that this is true, but maybe we can just choose to believe them, just this once? Sure, that boost in sales might have just been that I joined the store right before the holiday season, but maybe I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; boost sales by 10%?
Most people I know, &lt;em&gt;including myself&lt;/em&gt;, have some bullet points on their CVs that do not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; ring true in their heart of hearts. Here, I'll self-immolate first to get this party started. My CV says that I once saved A$500,000 off an employer's annual Snowflake bill. That's &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-accidentally-saved-half-a-million-dollars/"&gt;true&lt;/a&gt; and is where many of my readers come from. This makes me sound like some sort of Snowflake wizard, but the &lt;em&gt;reality&lt;/em&gt; of the matter is that I can only repeat this trick when working alongside people that throw away hundreds of thousands of dollars and don't ask questions like "How are we spending this much money on a few terabytes of data per year?" On a &lt;em&gt;competent&lt;/em&gt; team, I'm just like, a guy. Don't get me wrong, being a vaguely competent person is &lt;em&gt;not bad&lt;/em&gt; when the bar is subterranean, but that's &lt;em&gt;not what that point on my CV is signalling&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and the interviewee has got kids. Kids require food and are useful devices to justify arbitrary immoral behavior. What now, Never Lie Guy? What now? You wanna go, huh? You wanna fucking g-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-technically-true-is-still-a-lie"&gt;II. Technically True Is Still A Lie&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apologies, I don't know what came over me. Now that the red mist has lifted, the topic of whether it's okay to slightly (or extensively) smudge a CV warrants discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years ago, I came across an article titled &lt;a href="https://medium.com/the-bad-influence/tim-ferrisss-scam-framework-and-the-rise-of-fake-gurus-40d96283f02c"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tim Ferriss’s Scam Framework and the Rise of Fake Gurus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is now unfortunately walled by a Medium sign-in, but had some choice quotes on this sort of &lt;em&gt;technically true&lt;/em&gt; lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a friend of mine just three weeks to become a “top relationship expert who, as featured in Glamour and other national media, has counselled executives at Fortune 500 companies on how to improve their relationships in 24 hours or less.” How did she do it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then goes on to a methodology to make this happen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join 2–3 trade related organisations with official sounding names.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the top 3 best selling books on your topic and summarize each on one page.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give a free 1–3 hour seminar at the closest well known university.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do the same at branches of two well-known, big companies. Use the fact that you have given seminars at the university for credibility to get the booking. And so on.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He finishes by saying that he doesn’t recommend pretending to be something you’re not, and “presenting the truth in the best light, not fabricating it, is the name of the game.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry, but that’s a bunch of BS. Reading a few books and passing yourself off as an expert might not be illegal in the same way as claiming a qualification you don’t have, but it’s just as immoral and scammy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just like that, I was enlightened. Nineteen year old me was very intelligent in the specific way that programmers tend to be, and very unwise in the way that nineteen year olds who think they are very intelligent tend to be, and these sorts of half-truths felt like finding an interesting hack, or finding a poorly-worded clause in a board game. I probably would have tried &lt;em&gt;exactly this&lt;/em&gt;, and I'd have gotten away with it too. But it's actually &lt;em&gt;just lying&lt;/em&gt;, right? I have carefully selected a series of words that have been designed to conjure up a false image in another person's mind. Sure, maybe this is defensible in a court of law, but that's more-or-less unrelated to the ethics of the action. The &lt;em&gt;active ingredient&lt;/em&gt; of the lie, the epistemic violence, is fully present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone tells me they &lt;em&gt;spoke at Harvard&lt;/em&gt; when they actually booked out an empty room to spout nonsense into the void about their awful relationship advice, they &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that I am imagining that professors signed off on their expertise and allowed them to address some of the brightest (or at least richest) students in the country. Any amount of hand waving about how I shouldn't have made assumptions is, simply put, bullshit, with all the sophistication of a child poking their sibling with a stick, and defending themselves with "But &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; didn't touch them! The &lt;em&gt;stick&lt;/em&gt; did!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please, you're an &lt;em&gt;adult&lt;/em&gt;, face your crimes with a modicum of dignity. Or, you know, just fucking lie if you &lt;em&gt;insist&lt;/em&gt; on being awful. You're being just as dishonest for all intents and purposes, you can tell &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; better lies without constraints, and you're at least not wasting your own time. If that sounds unethical &lt;em&gt;then you shouldn't be telling technical truths either&lt;/em&gt;, because, and I cannot repeat this enough, &lt;em&gt;technical truths are just as bad&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; any different than Successful Governance Person saying that their governance initiatives were successful? Is it different from their staff doing it? In reality, &lt;em&gt;probably not&lt;/em&gt;. It's all premeditated deception, dishonesty as a strategy, and everyone I know has lines on their CV that &lt;em&gt;they don't believe in&lt;/em&gt;. This is what it means to be in the Vortex. I suspect Nat's CV, by virtue of finding a place that does work Nat actually believed in, is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; peppered with nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, most importantly, Tim Ferriss is a good interviewer but also sounds like a morally compromised maniac.&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-the-playing-field-and-status-laundering"&gt;III. The Playing Field and Status Laundering&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm assuming you're still with me, because I don't think the points above are very controversial. The market is flooded with people who &lt;em&gt;lie&lt;/em&gt; for a reasonable definition of lie - that is, intent to misrepresent themselves - and it turns out that &lt;em&gt;unfortunately&lt;/em&gt; it's quite easy to end up in a position where you're trailing inglorious failure through no serious fault of your own. Good candidates can end up in positions where they are very vulnerable &lt;em&gt;unless&lt;/em&gt; they happen to run into an interviewer who has done enough self-work to treat them as a person, and be open to serious vulnerability, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; they have to understand enough about the reality of the industry to act appropriately. Once we set aside tying ourselves into pretzels trying to explain how we personally didn't &lt;em&gt;lie&lt;/em&gt;, all we're left with is the consequences of our actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second issue is that the &lt;em&gt;playing field&lt;/em&gt; we are on is quite dire. To quote a reader who works at one of Australia's few &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; companies, they once looked at the broader market and concluded that it is "bleak". That is, the &lt;em&gt;money&lt;/em&gt; is good and the &lt;em&gt;likelihood&lt;/em&gt; of getting hired is good, but the culture of the companies involved is not serious. Version control, for example, is largely treated as a drag on speed across the government, education, and healthcare spaces. A "database" is usually a spreadsheet. Every "digital transformation" goes wrong in such obvious ways that I've started to register my predictions with employers so that they offer me work in a year when it all goes to hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or consider a conversation I had with one of Melbourne's rare technical CEOs a few weeks ago. I very sincerely asked them where one finds serious opportunities to do good work and upskill on humane teams - they named two or three companies, then admitted that they grew so disgusted with the job market that they had to &lt;em&gt;leave the country&lt;/em&gt; to find a place that didn't suck. &lt;em&gt;That's&lt;/em&gt; how hard it is to find a place that takes their work seriously - you have to be open to international travel because good local opportunities will not arise with any consistency, even in a first world city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am trying to say is that I currently believe that &lt;em&gt;there are not enough employers who will appreciate honesty and competence&lt;/em&gt; for a strategy of honesty to reliably pay your rent. My concern, with regards to Nat's original article, is that the industry is so primed with nonsense that we effectively have &lt;em&gt;two industries&lt;/em&gt;. We have a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; engineering market, where people are fairly serious and gather in small conclaves (only two of which I have seen, and one of those was through a blog reader's introduction), and then a &lt;em&gt;gigantic&lt;/em&gt; field of people that are cosplaying at engineering. The &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; market is large in absolute terms, but &lt;em&gt;tiny&lt;/em&gt; relative to the number of candidates and companies out there. The fake market is all people that haven't cultivated the discipline to engineer but nonetheless want software engineering salaries and clout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke to Luke Kanies, founder of Puppet and writer of this &lt;a href="https://lukekanies.com/writing/"&gt;excellent blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, who said the following about &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; Puppet exists after listening to an episode of my podcast:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A huge part of why I built Puppet is because most ops people never did what you and &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessetalford"&gt;Jesse&lt;/a&gt; discussed: turn failure into knowledge, and avoid future stupidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, thank you Luke, I will use this as yet another brick in the unassailable bastion of my ego. But more importantly, &lt;em&gt;is no one else concerned&lt;/em&gt;? Most ops people never &lt;em&gt;turn failure into knowledge&lt;/em&gt;? That's called &lt;em&gt;fucking learning&lt;/em&gt;! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! And I suspect ops people are &lt;em&gt;a lot more serious&lt;/em&gt; than other subdisciplines because you can't bullshit your way through a network failure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To paraphrase the only recruiter I've met who can write software well enough to tell when employers are full of it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer to place people at good companies, but there are so few that I have to engage with the rest of the market to make ends meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="status-laundering-and-bad-actors"&gt;Status Laundering and Bad Actors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;fundamental&lt;/em&gt; issue is that the majority of the industry is not seriously engaged in engineering. They are engaged in a convoluted and snails-paced theft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say that I am an engineering manager, or CEO, or what have you, and that I am not particularly good at it. I've never done either of these things, so that's overwhelmingly likely to be true. The company has given me access to anywhere between a million to a hundred million dollars in the form of assets and salaries. Unfortunately, while I would &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; to put all that money in my pocket, where I would at least spend it on a yacht instead of wasting it on new internal chatbots that only tell my employees to do something illegal about 10% of the time, I am unable to do so because the cowards in finance keep whining about embezzlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What am I to do? Well, for the low, low price of lots of someone &lt;em&gt;else's&lt;/em&gt; money, I can very, very inefficiently convert company wealth into personal status, and then convert &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; into money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, one of the people responsible for the architecture described in my post about &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-accidentally-saved-half-a-million-dollars/"&gt;Snowflake madness&lt;/a&gt; regularly gives talks about their state-of-the-art infrastructure, which I should remind you &lt;em&gt;is mostly SharePoint strapped to Lambda strapped to DynamoDB strapped to a managed data warehouse&lt;/em&gt; to ingest like data approximately the size of one copy of Call of Duty every day. Was it wasting half a million dollars and, in fact, a shrine to Mad Cyric upon His black throne? Yes. &lt;em&gt;Is that going to get them a A$50,000 raise one day&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt;. We'd have been better off if they just &lt;em&gt;stole A$200,000&lt;/em&gt; but if they do it this way then it's legal, and &lt;em&gt;everyone is worse off than they could have been, including them&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I call this extremely high friction way of stealing from companies &lt;em&gt;status laundering&lt;/em&gt;, which has polled as &lt;em&gt;extremely funny&lt;/em&gt; with focus groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reality of our industry (probably most industries, but ours in particular) drastically complicates the issue of lying. Doing technical work effectively is &lt;em&gt;so profitable&lt;/em&gt; that being seen as someone in the space is intrinsically high status. Unfortunately &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; being in the space requires an extremely sophisticated worldview, so we instead have tons of people playing at it. The number of people that are &lt;em&gt;pretending&lt;/em&gt; to understand how to do this whole software thing correctly vastly outstrips the number of people who &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do it correctly. And since most of the market is &lt;em&gt;playing&lt;/em&gt; at it, it turns out that a lot of jobs do not exist for people that honestly present their achievements, because people are looking for indicators that you will either bullshit alongside them &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; are that you aren't going to say the emperor has no clothes. I've still never seen a codebase at an employer with tests in it that I didn't write myself, and frankly, I barely have the energy on the median team these days - management &lt;em&gt;gets upset&lt;/em&gt; because they fundamentally don't believe me when I say &lt;em&gt;knowing if your code works&lt;/em&gt; lets you ship faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people conducting interviews &lt;em&gt;want you to say whatever they want to hear&lt;/em&gt;, and they are, to quote Patrick McKenzie, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/936619640012226560?lang=en"&gt;fundamentally unserious&lt;/a&gt; about how they hire. The majority of jobs available in Melbourne (and thus, probably elsewhere) are gatekept by people that very obviously have no idea what they're doing from even &lt;em&gt;brief&lt;/em&gt; skims of their professional profiles. I have also run into &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; directors that either run stupid technical interviews, or they don't run technical interviews at all. The former can be done well, but it does tend to be useless trivia (and I'm not being salty here, I've cleared the hardest ones I've sat!). The &lt;em&gt;latter&lt;/em&gt; I have a 100% success rate at, but it's because it's so easy to work out what their levers are and pull them. They &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; they're great judges of character, but they're just selecting for people that make them feel high-status and unthreatened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some companies where your interviewer is going to be a reasonable person, and &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt; you can be totally honest. For example, it is a &lt;em&gt;good thing&lt;/em&gt; to admit that the last project didn't go that well, because the kind of person that sees the industry for what it is, and who doesn't endorse bullshit, and who works on themselves diligently - &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; person is going to hear your honesty, and is probably reasonably good at detecting when candidates are revealing &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; enough fake problems to fake honesty, and then they will hire you. You will both put down your weapons and embrace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is very rare&lt;/em&gt;. A strategy that is based on assuming this happens if you keep repeatedly engaging with random companies on the market is overwhelmingly going to result in a long, long search. For the most part, you will be engaged in a twisted, adversarial game with actors who will relentlessly try to do things like make you say a number first in case you say one that's too low. Or informally promise you remote work, as pals, but not put it in the contract. They will usually understand very little about their jobs, have shoddy interpersonal skills that are compensated for by the corporate social script, and will use the interview as an opportunity to address their unmet psychological needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Southeast Asia, I knew someone that would &lt;em&gt;terrorize&lt;/em&gt; new candidates by asking them to provide Fermi estimates (i.,e how effectively can you make estimates around a question like "How many sunglasses are sold in Malaysia every year?" with no data). The interviewer was actually quite a smart guy, but it was absolutely transparent to me that the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; point of this question was for him to feel smart, since he gets to decide what a reasonable assumption is, and the candidate who gets hired is the one who doesn't freeze up &lt;em&gt;and more importantly&lt;/em&gt; expresses awe when the interviewer quibbles over one of the assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you notice that the majority of interviewers are just trying to feel good about themselves, it becomes very easy to hack them. That deserves a post on its own, as I suspect this is an area where things come more easily to me. Immigrating to Australia exposed me to many, many systems where the only winning move was to debase yourself and beg a petty official for mercy, with your face in the dirt, and I &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to learn how to appease authority figures to remain in the country. Those days are blessedly behind me, but the brain learns to read status quickly when it is your main defense against deportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffice it to say that, if you grin in &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; the right way and keep a straight face, there is a large class of person that will hear you say "Hah, you know, I'm just reflecting on how nice it is to be in a room full of people who are asking &lt;em&gt;the right questions&lt;/em&gt; after all my other terrible interviews." and then they will shake your hand even as they shatter the other one patting themselves on the back at Mach 10. I know, I know, it sounds like that doesn't work &lt;em&gt;but it absolutely does&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is basically weaponized therapy. You meditate, reflect, do self-work, speak to professionals and the like because you don't want to be a monkey that treats the people closest to you based on whatever the monkey-brain decides its immediate ego needs are, and then you realize that &lt;em&gt;most people are fully in the grips of monkey-brain&lt;/em&gt;. You just throw a banana in the cage and slam the door shut behind them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us evaluate your board position if you operate this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro: Surrounded by money.&lt;br&gt;
Con: Surrounded by monkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll take the money, but I don't want to be surrounded by monkey. Nat is onto something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="interlude-neil-gaiman-on-lying"&gt;Interlude: Neil Gaiman On Lying&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People get hired because, somehow, they get hired. In my case I did something which these days would be easy to check, and would get me into trouble, and when I started out, in those pre-internet days, seemed like a sensible career strategy: when I was asked by editors who I'd worked for, I lied. I listed a handful of magazines that sounded likely, and I sounded confident, and I got jobs. I then made it a point of honour to have written something for each of the magazines I'd listed to get that first job, so that I hadn't actually lied, I'd just been chronologically challenged... You get work however you get work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="projects-are-default-dead"&gt;Projects Are Default Dead&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most projects &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; had a chance of succeeding, so unless you somehow have the ability to discern what those projects are up-front&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, you're going to &lt;em&gt;start off&lt;/em&gt; with some weak talking points on that first gig. My very first job in tech, which I took gratefully due to my sad, sad postgraduate visa, was advertised as a data scientist position at a nationally-recognized institution that was getting serious about artificial intelligence. I did &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; but clean spreadsheets for two years, try to manage a legacy Oracle database that we eventually found out didn't have any indexes and all the primary keys were just &lt;em&gt;named&lt;/em&gt; primary key but didn't have the actual constraint, and finally fail to ship a CRUD app because I was a &lt;em&gt;data scientist&lt;/em&gt; being asked to write integrations into as many systems as our stakeholders could dream up - usually a new system every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, I nailed every question on that interview, but lied at the very end. One of the interviewers asked, "Do you know what ETL is?", and I, not having learned this at university somehow, said "Yes, of course" because I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; needed the job and panicked. I was hired, but I just realized, having worked with that person, &lt;em&gt;they didn't know what ETL was either&lt;/em&gt; and they would have failed me for not knowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most importantly, how was I to know better than to take that job and how do I make the jump out? At that point, I was two years in, hadn't really acquired any serious skills, and rent kept going up. I've learned a lot in my own time, at great personal expense, such as not touching grass after work and drifting ever closer to sacrificing my humanity to become one with The Machine, but that doesn't show up as a bullet point that 95% of employers care about, or indeed, are able to discern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I say "I learned Phoenix for fun", most employers say "Wat dat?", presumably while picking their noses and scratching themselves rudely. "I've read High Output Management" is met by "Oh, I prefer LinkedIn to books". No one checks my GitHub, as paltry as it is, and almost every company cannot understand anything other than how many years my CV says I've worked with a particular buzzword. A few are different, but there is no guarantee they'll be hiring for roles that I'm qualified for within any given year, and there's no guarantee I'll get hired if they do - skill atrophy is a real thing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For basically everywhere else, ranging from the government to Deloitte, &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; other than "I have four years experience working on a team that has the words you're looking for, leaving aside the fact that must mean &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; hired me without having that experience, and the only issue was this one fabricated dilemma to make me sound like I'm a straight shooter" is met by awkward silence. This is the real thing behind resume driven development. By turning on DynamoDB for no reason then waiting for five years, everyone has five years of experience using DynamoDB, &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a sobering thought to realize that the average business &lt;em&gt;has not worked out how to finish a CRUD app on schedule&lt;/em&gt;, and will frequently be off by &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt;. It is more sobering to realize that &lt;em&gt;all professions have this level of dysfunction in them if you talk to professionals&lt;/em&gt;, but that is &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; sobering and would leave us positively &lt;a href="https://wiki.lspace.org/Knurd"&gt;knurd&lt;/a&gt;, so we're going to leave that aside for now and just focus on tech. People that cannot ship a CRUD app will sit in judgement, and they will think you're a fucking &lt;em&gt;moron&lt;/em&gt; for your Actually Shipping ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the question remains: Assume that most projects are default dead. We should do this, because a major institution recently sent me a job titled "Senior Snowflake &lt;em&gt;Engnieer&lt;/em&gt;" and they left all the edit history in the word document, so I could see them fail to spell the word "model". And furthermore, most employers are not interested or &lt;em&gt;capable&lt;/em&gt; of evaluating your technical competence in the absence of a vaunted procession of victories. &lt;em&gt;How do you escape the Infinite Lie Vortex&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv-get-me-out-of-this-rat-hole"&gt;IV. Get Me Out Of This Rat Hole&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Infinite Lie Vortex &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be escaped. It's &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt; in there - everyone keeps talking about Scrum, and sometimes they beat you for asking people not to rubber stamp PRs. It is superior to financial stress, but vastly inferior to being near people that you actually respect for eight hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nat Bennett, of Start Of This Article fame, writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to be the kind of person who walks away from your job when you're asked to do something that doesn't fit your values, you need to save money. You need to maintain low fixed expenses.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acting with integrity – or whatever it is that you value – mostly isn't about making the right decision in the moment. It's mostly about the decisions that you make leading up to that moment, that prepare you to be able to make the decision that you feel is right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is brutal advice, but it is the sad truth. My escape from that &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; job came from someone who I had cultivated a relationship with over about six years, and at one point provided them an amount of help on a programming assignment that was &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; a breach of academic integrity due to some very serious stuff they were dealing with in their personal lives. If I had needed to leave &lt;em&gt;without having that groundwork in place&lt;/em&gt;, I would have been totally trapped unless I outright lied, and then I'd &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; have been in the Infinite Lie Vortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a rough rule, if I've let my relationship with a job deteriorate to the point that I &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; leave, I have already waited way too long, and will be forced to move to another place that is similarly upsetting. The last time I spoke with reader &lt;a href="https://infosec.exchange/@imclaren"&gt;Iain McLaren&lt;/a&gt;, our resident Go-slinging lawyer and designated person who gets slightly distressed when I put a company on blast by name, I had just rejected some &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/most-tech-jobs-are-jokes-and-i-am-not-laughing/"&gt;very stupid&lt;/a&gt; jobs. I was reflecting on how weird it felt to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; desperately take the first job on the table, because I'm now a financially secure permanent resident now, and arguably slightly unhinged. He said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people are moving away from things, which is very different from moving towards something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is, of course, what had gradually happened. I &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; painfully navigated the immigration process, trimmed my expenses, found a position that is frequently silly &lt;em&gt;but tolerable for extended periods of time&lt;/em&gt;, and started looking for work before the new gig, mostly the same as the last gig, became unbearable. Everything other than the immigration process was burnout induced, so I can't claim that it was a clever strategy, but the net effect is that I kept sacrificing things at the altar of Being Okay With Less, and now I am in an apartment so small that I think I almost fractured my little toe banging it on the side of my bed frame, but &lt;em&gt;I have the luxury of not lying&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to write down what a &lt;em&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt; exit pathway looks like, it might be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a job even if you must navigate the Vortex, and it doesn't matter if it's bad because there's a grace period where your brain is not soaking up the local brand of madness, i.e, when you don't even &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; the local politics yet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meet good programmers that appreciate things like mindfulness in your local area - you're going to have to figure out how to do this one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat Step 1 and Step 2 on a loop, building yourself up as a person, engineer, and friend, until someone who &lt;em&gt;knows you for you&lt;/em&gt; hires you based on your personality and values, rather than "I have seven years doing bullshit in React that clearly should have been ten raw HTML pages served off one Django server"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pathway to riches is probably &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; honesty. Or at least, you'll have some riches, but not as much as you could have, by a long way. That's okay. For all the hand-wringing about children and expenses, my father grew up in post-occupation Malaysia, where I am told even sugar was rationed. He studied surgery in India, living out of a hostel where they heated water by dropping induction coils into containers, and every morning a wave of cockroaches would go scurrying out of the bathroom when he flicked the lights on. Sometimes you just do hard things - I'm grateful that I don't have to, but I value his character more than his money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don't get me wrong, and that is where the nuance comes in, I get to say this &lt;em&gt;because he is the one that dealt with the cockroaches&lt;/em&gt;. Who could have blamed him for lying?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And once you're authentic, the median employer &lt;em&gt;hates it&lt;/em&gt;. They loved the version of me that went, "Wow, that's really amazing, how you've done all that data science work. SageMaker Canvas? SageMaker with a drag-and-drop interface?&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Gosh golly mister, that's a &lt;em&gt;swell&lt;/em&gt; idea, it's about time we could get rid of those sweaty programmers! What we &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need is more people with LinkedIn Agile qualifications doing engineering work!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; the version of me that goes "So that's your manager over there? &lt;em&gt;Why&lt;/em&gt; are you hiring ten data scientists in the span of a month with no technical interview, exactly? Does your team use Git? Are your story points time estimates? How exactly will rolling out GenAI across the bank's &lt;em&gt;finance&lt;/em&gt; department improve revenue? What's a hash table? Fellas, wait, where are you going!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the important thing is that regardless of what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; think, &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; like the second version of me, who is not secure yet, but we can also escape the Vortex by taking risks. My risk-laden CV looks more like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm just some guy figuring things out. I like simple systems, and it's unclear if that's because they're better or I'm a dullard, and my experience has probably made me &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; suspicious of any solution that isn't Just Use Postgres, You Bastard. My programming skill is a serious work-in-progress. A CEO here told me that he asks people to self-evaluate their skill on a scale of 1 to 10, but he actually has solid measures. You're at 10 at Python if you're a core maintainer. 9 if you speak at major international conferences, etc. On that scale, I'm a 4, or maybe a 5 on my best day ever, and that's the sad truth. We'll get there one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like writing code, and I can appreciate the need to write things that deliver value, but I will &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; hate writing code that moves the overall product further from Quality. I'll write a basic feature and take shortcuts, but not the kind that we are going to build on top of, which is unattractive to employers because sacrificing the long-term health of a product is a big part of status laundering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At my first job, I wrote a truly horrendous Python monstrosity with a factory spitting out lambda functions because I didn't read the documentation for the &lt;code&gt;pandas.DataFrame.apply&lt;/code&gt; method properly, which would have solved it instantly, and it is one of the two pieces of code that I have running in production &lt;em&gt;anywhere&lt;/em&gt;. People think it is because the code is &lt;em&gt;too advanced&lt;/em&gt; for weaker engineers to understand, and the compliments they shower upon me to this day are my greatest shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only piece of software I've written that is unambiguously helpful is &lt;a href="https://github.com/Nikhil-Suresh/swimbuds_podcast_splitter"&gt;this dumb hack&lt;/a&gt; that I used to cut up episodes of the Glass Cannon Podcast into one minute segments so that my &lt;code&gt;skip track&lt;/code&gt; button on my underwater headphones is now a janky &lt;code&gt;fast forward one minute&lt;/code&gt; button. It took me like ten minutes to write, and is my greatest pride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I earn A$80 a month on Patreon, and I have a company that earns way less money than it would have to in order to employ a single person full time. Clout supplies are at an all-time low, but friend supplies are through the roof. This blog does decent traffic, but not enough for anyone to have to actually take me seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I care enough that I read lots of books on programming, but the closest thing I have to a &lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt; engineering education comes from people on this blog that have agreed to provide me with professional guidance, like &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/jokes-for-jokers-with-jesse-alford/id1737204926?i=1000653157805"&gt;Jesse Alford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://sidhion.com/"&gt;Bernardo Stein&lt;/a&gt;, who I am very grateful for but are also in what I can only describe as &lt;em&gt;a whole other league&lt;/em&gt;. I can use Nix, but only because &lt;a href="https://github.com/l0b0"&gt;Victor Engmark&lt;/a&gt; walked me through what I can only describe as tantrums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have I actually worked with Google? My CV says so, but guess what, not quite! I worked on one project where the money came from Google, but we really had one call with one guy who said we were probably on track, which we definitely were not!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I salvage a A$1.2M project? Technically yes, &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/flexible-schemas-are-the-mindkiller/"&gt;but only because I forced the previous developer to actually give us his code before he quit!&lt;/a&gt; This is not replicable, and then the whole engineering team quit over a mandatory return to office, so the application never shipped!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I save a half million dollars in Snowflake expenses? CV says yes, &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-accidentally-saved-half-a-million-dollars/"&gt;reality says I can only repeat that trick if someone decided to set another pile of money on fire and hand me the fire extinguisher&lt;/a&gt;! Did I really receive departmental recognition for this? Yes, but only in that &lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/tech-management-has-bestowed-glory-upon-me/"&gt;they gave me A$30 and a pat on the head and told me that a raise wasn't on the table&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was I the most highly paid senior engineer at that company? &lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt;, but only because I had insider information that four people quit in the same week, and used that to negotiate a 20% raise over the next highest salary - the decision was based around executive KPIs, not my competence! They wouldn't know to pay me more based on competence if my name was Guido van Rossum!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I help an institution respond to audits? Sure, but everyone on the project got involved in a massive political knife fight and quit after I handed them the report on what needed to be remediated, so nothing happened!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fury! I help colleagues find work elsewhere if they get mistreated! Justice! I help people build a paper trail when they're bullied! Unfettered vengeance! I will make you fire me rather than betray my team! You should not hire me if you are a bastard!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweet freedom! I've never seen a test in production! Exultation! I made development containers once but a Scrum master told me I was wasting my time! Liberty! I've never trained a model that was used for anything! Jubilation! Joy! Blessed condemnation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exoneration! Confession and lightness! Immolation and purity!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My career may be mud, but at least I'm honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or at least, "actually it's very complicated", which you must admit doesn't sound as good.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've heard that criticizing Tim Ferris is how you &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; get hatemail, so hopefully I'll &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; get some of the good stuff.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at me namedrop famous people, ma! I've made the big time, and I didn't even have to lie about this one!&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me about four years, but now I can recognize the worst jobs within about thirty seconds of listening to employers talk because &lt;em&gt;they're all failing in exactly the same ways&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A real product that AWS demo'd to me at a previous job, with an example of a &lt;em&gt;real estate agent&lt;/em&gt; that wanted to &lt;em&gt;use fucking AWS to create a random forest using AutoML&lt;/em&gt;. Is everything okay over at Amazon? Should we send help? What on &lt;em&gt;earth&lt;/em&gt; do you think real estate agents are like?&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/the-complex-problem-of-lying-for-jobs/</guid></item><item><title>Reflecting On Years Of Runescape</title><link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/reflecting-on-years-of-runescape/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Growing up, my friends and I were in the unenviable position of being first language English speakers who were enamored by Western culture. The life of eleven year olds that read &lt;em&gt;Eragon&lt;/em&gt; instead of playing football was isolated, to say the least. The main escapes we had in a world where we attended thousands of hours of schooling without being able to communicate with our Malay-speaking teachers was reading and gaming. And the main game we played, on ancient hardware and dial-up connections, was Runescape, a small browser-based online game that was created by two brothers from their parent's house which somehow turned over £120M in revenue in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world and community of the game have accumulated so many layers of history and nuance that I feel like I could muse for months without exhausting the well, and that's from someone who hasn't played in years. The game has existed with more-or-less constant development for over twenty years, and this has packed it lore and history. And of course, lessons, some of which I learned as a child and some which are only evident looking back as an adult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is the sheer delightful &lt;em&gt;weirdness&lt;/em&gt; of the people that play into their adulthood, the unadulterated (a fitting word!) heart of the world and developers, the countless memories, and the community which has formed around the game. There's the absolutely awful design decisions, and how that didn't matter because the alchemy of music, passion, and children's imaginations nonetheless created a juggernaut of an experience that has survived the decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And looking back, the plentiful scams were a quick and painful lesson that there's an ugly side to humanity. There's the decidedly &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; delightful weirdness when you think about how much time some of those people spend clicking through an ancient browser game. There's the strange metamorphosis the game has undergone alongside its now grown-up players from a wondrous sandbox (and it still is, sometimes!) to an astonishing exercise in efficiency maximization, complete with exploiting the game engine's tick rate and a stock market. And of course, as always with the systems we live in, the acquisition of the company and how that seems to inevitably leak the bottom line into the player experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yes, most importantly, the fact that I &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; this game despite all that, and how I think it's a monument to what screwing around with a computer and your imagination can do for the world. I'm not sure what the exact pathway was, but I probably wouldn't be interested in writing or computers were it not for Runescape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I almost didn't write this. To some large degree, this blog &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; my professional profile, and I was acutely embarrassed to be writing about something so juvenile even as I've just entered my 30s. I don't even &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt; it anymore. At least my issues with the engineering world are &lt;em&gt;mature&lt;/em&gt;, in topic if not in tone. But on the other hand, who cares? We're talking about a game where you click on rocks for hundreds of hours! Strap in for some nostalgia and contemplation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i-a-brief-history"&gt;I. A Brief History&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game has already lived through three iterations. There was the original &lt;em&gt;Runescape Classic&lt;/em&gt;, now defunct, released in 2001, which looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Runescape Classic.jpg" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/e9d4e6e1.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh baby, those are some cutting-edge graphics. I never played this version of the game, but I have to admit that it isn't quite as bad as I remembered. &lt;em&gt;Classic&lt;/em&gt; was developed by two brothers and originally hosted out of their parent's house in Nottingham, which is delightful software lore. It reminds me very much of reading about the Discworld Multi-User Dungeon (a MUD; or text-based MMO) &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld_MUD"&gt;struggles with finding a home&lt;/a&gt; in the pre-cloud days:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MUD was later hosted for a time at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut by one of its undergraduates: Michael "Bastian" Hammill. "Bastian" served as chief administrator of the game and "god" of Discworld (a character role), while "Pinkfish" continued in his capacity as head game developer. The school's IT administrator eventually ruled the project a hacking attempt due to multiple UNIX rlogin attempts from across the globe. This was actually just the game developers, or "creators", working as part of an international programming effort. The mistake cost the MUD another one of its homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2004, they released &lt;em&gt;Runescape 2&lt;/em&gt;, which looks like this and immediately transports me to my childhood, clicking away happily but with minimal comprehension on my grandfather's computer, which I hazily recall was running Windows 98.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Runescape 2.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/b0252706.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn't even find an image of the game from when I used to play it, as I'm pretty sure that fellow in blue on the far left of the image was only added when I was in high school. I probably sank hundreds of hours into the game as a kid, which I regretted not spending on mathematics until I was 26, at which point I decided productivity obsession is for dorks. My first character was &lt;em&gt;blastoise46&lt;/em&gt; who has sadly been lost to the dreadful and manifold hazards of forgetting my password, forgetting which of my parents let me use their email address to make the account, and customer support never getting back to me on account recovery options&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I stopped playing, but the game kept growing and the original company was acquired. They come out with Runescape 3, which looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Runescape 3.jpg" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/3aae92e2.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've barely touched this, but despite looking much better, there's something off about it. It is mechanically improved in countless ways over the original, but in others ways it never sat right with me, like someone polished up the game without realizing what parts made it so charming in the first place. It's a strange, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtransaction"&gt;microtransaction&lt;/a&gt;-laden, gambling-encouraging mess, a part of my childhood resurrected into a well-dressed but nonetheless obviously-a-zombie that is lurching towards my wallet instead of my brains&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the developers release &lt;em&gt;Runescape 2&lt;/em&gt; once more, this time under the name &lt;em&gt;Old School Runescape&lt;/em&gt;, restoring the game to its state circa 2007. It's usually called &lt;em&gt;OSRS&lt;/em&gt; these days, and I'll largely be talking about &lt;em&gt;OSRS&lt;/em&gt; or the older &lt;em&gt;Runescape 2&lt;/em&gt; for the rest of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ii-scams"&gt;II. Scams&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The absolute first and most valuable thing you learn playing &lt;em&gt;OSRS&lt;/em&gt; is that the world has some fucking bastards in it, that will say or do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; to benefit at your expense if they believe they aren't going to get caught. That's a rough thing to learn as a kid - and the internet is replete with accounts of people recalling how much they wept the first time someone stole their stuff in the game - but I'm sure glad I learned it with fake video game armor instead of NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most famous scam was probably the old "trimming armor" trick, and the &lt;em&gt;spirit&lt;/em&gt; of this trick underlies most of the way that people are going to try to steal your money. You see, all armor came in two variants - the normal version, and the gold-trimmed version. They looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="osrs_armor_difference.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/0b22a24b.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The armor on the right, the "trimmed" version, was much rarer. The only issue with this is that there was absolutely no difference between these two sets of armor mechanically. Yes, one of these &lt;em&gt;looked&lt;/em&gt; superficially better, but people were rational enough that they weren't going to spend piles of money on something that is exactly the same but more painful to lose when you died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just kidding, people were the same back then, the armor on the right was worth &lt;em&gt;infinity dollars&lt;/em&gt;. But of course, with so many kids around and the concept of &lt;em&gt;Googling&lt;/em&gt; things being a little bit hazier, most players had no idea how the gold-trimmed armor was produced. The truth is you &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; produce it, it comes as a rare reward for doing certain activities in-game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you would run into in basically &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; town in the game was someone saying "Trimming armor!", "Trimming armor for free!", or possibly "Trimming armor 5k!".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="armour-meme.jpg" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/7de4a48a.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would hand the player your armor, whereupon they would either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promptly log out, never to be seen again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hang around and rub their victory in your face&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't remember if this was actually the scam that made me realize how this particularly ugly part of the human soul operates, but it must have been something like this, and in retrospect a suit of fake mithril armor for such an incredible lesson was one of the best deals I've ever made. I must thank the scammer for it, wherever that dickhead is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young children do not actually perform any calculations around whether they're likely to lose their items when they hand them over - they just hand them over and are absolutely &lt;em&gt;astonished&lt;/em&gt; to see that someone would simply take the item and disappear, cackling. To most children, this is a novel human experience, and for the first time you realize that there are people with calculated malice that you cannot fathom, and that there are domains where the God-figures of teachers and parents cannot answer prayers. Yes, you may cry, but you are met by baffled incomprehension and platitudes, but &lt;em&gt;not your stuff back&lt;/em&gt; which is what you actually want. Ya fucked up, kid, sorry, happens to the best of us. Children are easily overwhelmed by their excitement and credulity. But there are some lessons to ponder even looking back as an adult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Last Psychiatrist&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is a blog with a few fascinating, if somewhat incoherent, articles on human psychology. One that I ran into early at university was &lt;a href="https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2013/05/dove.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dove Sketches Beauty Scam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which illustrated to me the value in occasionally being taken for a ride, particularly in amounts you can afford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If some street hustler challenges you to a game of three card monte you don't need to bother to play, just hand him the money, not because you're going to lose but because you owe him for the insight: he selected you.  Whatever he saw in you everyone sees in you, from the dumb blonde&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; at the bar to your elderly father you've dismissed as out of touch, the only person who doesn't see it is you, which is why you fell for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Players were rarely hand-picked for the scam above (it was mostly blindfired into the masses and you'd let them self-select, like a Twitter account pumping NFTs), but there are still things to reflect on and learn from. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="armour-meme.jpg" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/7de4a48a.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice how he &lt;em&gt;isn't wearing gold-trimmed armor&lt;/em&gt;? That's because people that could actually afford it didn't need to scam people for money! But kids get excited and flustered, and the next thing they know they've been unceremoniously welcomed to the real world - so glad you could join us, we keep the financial anxiety in the cupboard to your left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, adults are a lot smarter than this, and would certainly notice the incongruity of someone who claims to be able to produce something incredibly valuable day in and day out, but instead opts to stand around extolling their virtues and begging people to purchase it for a relative pittance instead of earning millions directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, I'm a world-class business leader, and I've decided to make my very real secrets available to you for the low, low price of A$50 if you want my book or A$10,000 for a speaking engagement. If you'd like, I could also fill in as your CEO for say, a million dollars, and this company will have an &lt;em&gt;embarrassment&lt;/em&gt; of profits, like you wouldn't believe. Oh, yes, I have plenty of experience running Salesforce migrations, and they were all successful even though you've never seen a successful one before. I'll do that for you &lt;em&gt;instead&lt;/em&gt; of using that astonishing capability to repeatedly &lt;em&gt;actually generate&lt;/em&gt; incalculable revenue and paying myself out of that. Out of the kindness of my heart, xoxo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Thought leaders" are, fundamentally, just saying "trimming companies for $500,000", and Runescape gave me the antibodies I need to &lt;em&gt;not buy that&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are other things to reflect on too. The property of a system that allows you to simply take someone's money and proverbially log out is &lt;em&gt;explicitly&lt;/em&gt; supported by the cryptocurrency ecosystem, which &lt;em&gt;literal children&lt;/em&gt; can tell you is a bad thing after the old armour trimming shenanigans, but miraculously is talked about as a largely positive trait instead of something &lt;em&gt;extremely bad outside of very narrow circumstances&lt;/em&gt;. Yes, the government will take your money in some places, &lt;em&gt;but so will armour trimmers and you won't have any recourse&lt;/em&gt;. Plus, a malevolent actor can still take your money with the highly sophisticated "crowbar to your knees until we stop getting invalid passwords" attack&lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I credit witnessing the endless profusion of scams in Runescape with laying the foundation for my critical thinking as an adult. There's a lot to learn from the threefold insights of realizing that truly shameless thieves exist, that some systems support their existence, and that &lt;em&gt;there are systems inside your head&lt;/em&gt; that make you more likely to be taken in if you let them run wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iii-problem-shallowness"&gt;III. Problem Shallowness&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a catchy saying in software engineering going by the name of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law"&gt;Linus's Law&lt;/a&gt; despite being written by a guy called Raymond. It is usually presented as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, framed in terms of real-world application, if &lt;em&gt;enough people look at a thing&lt;/em&gt;, the probability that someone will have the correct two neurons primed to immediately understand and solve the problem approaches 100%. This is something that I had mostly assumed to be true in the video gaming community, which is why the re-release of &lt;em&gt;OSRS&lt;/em&gt; has been startling to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game was &lt;em&gt;hardly&lt;/em&gt; unpopular, and while a large proportion of the playerbase was certainly quite young, there were many adults playing even in the early 2000s. I distinctly recall chatting, at the ripe age of 12, with a French elevator technician named &lt;em&gt;omlette2112&lt;/em&gt;, and I'm not sure why that is seared into my brain. My assumption would have been that something approximating optimal play would have been achieved relatively quickly, &lt;em&gt;particularly&lt;/em&gt; in a game where the main combat mechanic is simply click on monsters and waiting until they die, while periodically using a healing item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the last time I read something about the game, there was reference to a phenomenon known as "prayer flicking", which simply &lt;em&gt;did not exist&lt;/em&gt; when I used to play, and it is absolutely wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By way of explanation, players have access to a powerful set of temporary buffs that drain a resource called "prayer points". The most powerful example are typically called "overhead" prayers, buffs so strong that they appear above your character's head to indicate that they have become totally immune to an incoming damage type. This character is currently using &lt;em&gt;Protect From Melee&lt;/em&gt; and can't be hurt by anything other than an arrow or a spell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="overhead-melee.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/43490754.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, these drain your prayer points pretty quickly, otherwise people would just walk around immune to damage all day. Most enemies &lt;em&gt;only deal&lt;/em&gt; one damage type, so they just can't hurt you at all. Hah, yeah, it would be absolutely nuts if someone found a way to just become immune to damage indefinitely. Half the content would become obsolete overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know where this is going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Players worked out that the game updates its state once every 0.6 seconds (a "game tick"), for a total of 100 updates a minute. And if you turned your prayers on and off on &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the game ticks where your character was going to receive damage, then you would get the immunity forever &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; never lose prayer points because the prayer wouldn't be on during the tick where the points should be drained. Huge portions of the game are now balanced around the fact that players are going to be immune to entire damage categories for extended periods of time, and a large amount of early content is completely obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not even really sure how to think about this, because I am &lt;em&gt;unsurprised&lt;/em&gt; that the concentrated power of the gaming world was able to brutally exploit an oversight in the game's original design, which again, was made by two brothers, the elder of whom was merely &lt;em&gt;twenty five&lt;/em&gt; upon the release of &lt;em&gt;Runescape 2&lt;/em&gt;. That makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is strange to me is that it &lt;em&gt;wasn't&lt;/em&gt; picked up in the earlier release of the game. I really thought we would have approached whatever critical mass of people you need to find the infinite health glitch back in the day. Yes, the playerbase is &lt;em&gt;much older&lt;/em&gt; now, but still! There were many people around, and even putting that aside, kids are shockingly intelligent when there are video games to be won. A quick check reveals that the truly demented Tetris innovation of &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/nes-tetris-players-call-it-rolling-and-theyre-setting-1846767518"&gt;rolling&lt;/a&gt; was invented by Christopher Martinez at the ripe old age of fourteen, and I imagine we had orders of magnitude more people playing Runescape than Tetris. Still, interesting to think about - it's a profoundly hopeful thought that it's still possible to work hard and come up with novelties in a field that you would expect to be picked clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, that doesn't tell the whole story, because prayer flicking this way could require players to be clicking for twice every 0.6 seconds, which would be unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, just kidding, &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; that's what people have been doing. The human spirit is fucking indomitable, which is why we're going straight the hell back to the goddamn moon, you alien bastards, and why we spend thousands of hours collectively learning how to time our double clicks to preserve resources in an online game. This is &lt;em&gt;the same facet of the human soul&lt;/em&gt; and you can't have one without the other. One day a human is going to be building the first human habitation on Mars, and at that moment there will be an &lt;em&gt;equally dedicated&lt;/em&gt; sicko on earth working out how to improve his damage output in Runescape 7 by 5%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more concerning note, here is a thirty second video &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CP5OasEiS4"&gt;demonstrating how to use animated elements on the UI to time your clicks correctly&lt;/a&gt;. Now imagine someone doing that for anywhere between a minute to an hour because it's more efficient than playing the game the way it was originally intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at university, one of my philosophy lecturers made the argument that performance enhancing drugs leave professional athletes back where they started (relative to each other) except with drug-induced side effects. Each individual athlete might want drugs to be removed from the sport and to stop taking drugs themselves, but there's no way to stop this from happening due to the incentive structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I'm saying is that it seems &lt;em&gt;crazy&lt;/em&gt; that everyone added "click about four times a second" as a requirement to play large portions of their favorite game, and forced the designer to work around this, but &lt;em&gt;here we are&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iv-stonks"&gt;IV. Stonks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="stonks.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/136b8282.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way that the game &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to work when I was at school is that all trading between players happened manually. That is to say, you would log into the server named "World 1" and travel to a city called Varrock. You would then be greeted by up to two thousand people shouting out whatever they were buying or selling, and it was up to you to wade through that endless morass for whatever you wanted. I've frequently wondered how these norms are formed, but it was a fascinating exercise in self-organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="world_one.webp" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/1b2890e3.webp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back on all that weird, glowing text types that the developers made available, I can only say: "Wow, that is some 2004 energy." It's the sort of thing that is probably totally unwise to spend developer time on, it would not survive thirty seconds of feature prioritization at a more mature organization (even if I was doing doing the prioritization), and nonetheless all those sensible people must gaze on, absolutely stunlocked, as they fail to understand that terrible decisions like this are the fundamental magic, encoded a million times across what is probably a worse codebase than anything I've ever seen, that makes Runescape invincible and that puts so many well-reasoned experiences in the bargain bin of history through no fault of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, trying to buy items like this was quite the ordeal, and it was typically a lot simpler to &lt;em&gt;actually play the game&lt;/em&gt; and try to acquire things yourself than it was to stand around asking for them. But this also felt unsatisfactory, because sometimes you'd really want to buy something and would have no idea how to convert all that hard-earned money into useful stuff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter the &lt;a href="https://runescape.wiki/w/Grand_Exchange"&gt;Grand Exchange&lt;/a&gt; in 2007. The chaos of trading manually and desperately trying to draw attention to yourself was replaced with a bunch of people standing around, largely totally silently, placing orders on the fantasy stock exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="grand_exchange.jpg" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/cdb4d37e.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a certain nostalgia for the good old days where people actually hung around and talked to each other, but in retrospect that's hardly communication. It's mostly a bunch of people spamming as rapidly as possible when they'd much rather be doing something else, with too much noise for the possibility of a friendship to even develop after the transaction. But it did do something &lt;em&gt;else&lt;/em&gt; weird to the game, which is that it became &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; easy to rapidly convert any given resource into any &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; resource, which means that to some degree, all activities are now fungible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is to say, I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; go fletch a bunch of arrows to practice my archery, but it would be a lot easier to kill a bunch of cows because cow hides have undergone a massive price boost then convert those into &lt;em&gt;thousands&lt;/em&gt; of arrows within a few minutes. On the bright side, I've saved myself a lot of time! On the not so bright side, I've sort of... sidestepped engaging with the game systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose I don't have much of a problem with this, really, but I did think it was interesting how quickly I stopped playing the game after this update, even though it was basically a pure upgrade to my experience in material terms. There's probably some broader, very deep lesson here about how friction is an important part of some experiences. It brings to mind how, while having such an incredible ecosystem of Python libraries enables massive productivity, I always feel like I'm missing out by having the responsible solution to so many interesting problems be "use someone else's solution for it". Or all the time spent drilling footwork in fencing. While it seems &lt;em&gt;obvious&lt;/em&gt; that I'd prefer that time back, and a Matrix-machine that downloads the preliminary steps into our brains so that beginners can enjoy the sport immediately would be great, I also can't help but feel that something very important would be lost alongside it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, this feeling is so widespread that a game mode was released whose largest restriction is that you can't use the fantasy stock market. People will pay for an account to &lt;em&gt;turn the friction back on&lt;/em&gt; because the friction &lt;em&gt;is the experience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="v-on-releasing-trash"&gt;V. On Releasing Trash&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a wonderful lesson for people that feel their work isn't good enough to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The absolute worst skill in any game is Runescape's Firemaking skill. The original iteration, which stuck around for years, was so mind-bogglingly stupid that I still get vaguely triggered thinking about it. It's crazy that the game went through three iterations and they &lt;em&gt;never fixed the fundamental flaws with the skill&lt;/em&gt;, though they did eventually introduce some a minigame that let you more-or-less skip the skill entirely, which probably tells you all you need to know about how bad it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect I know how it came about - the original developers imagined a large open-world with survival mechanisms, and making a fire is how you would fend off starvation and the elements. This is because every time my friends and I got together in primary school and brainstormed a game, we'd always end up with something like this. But there is no weather in Runescape, nor is there hunger, and the world is so small that it's fairly trivial to just walk to the nearest storage location and grab stockpiled food instead - you almost never need to cook food on an open fire. But they kept the Firemaking skill in anyway, because that's the sort of thing you do when you're designing a game to host from your parent's house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead you've got a whole skill dedicated to settings logs on fire, with higher levels allowing you to set rare logs alight. The entire skill starts and ends with clicking on a tinderbox then clicking on some logs. At a rough guess, it probably takes around a &lt;em&gt;hundred&lt;/em&gt; hours of repeatedly clicking on a tinderbox then logs to get your skill to the highest possible level. And of course, the benefit of lighting higher level logs is...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N o t h i n g .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn't do a damn thing. Doesn't cook the food any better. Doesn't even burn longer, which would have been useless anyway since the normal logs last for long enough but &lt;em&gt;how did this get overlooked?&lt;/em&gt; It's actually strictly &lt;em&gt;inferior&lt;/em&gt; to have to leverage high level Firemaking because the trees are much rarer, and the fancy logs would have sold for more on the market. They just slapped this one in there and let it rip, and even made it compulsory to engage by gating quests behind the skill. Quests that usually don't even rely on the Firemaking mechanic! The game is riddled with all sorts of strange things like this, such as archery consisting of a single skill that determines your accuracy and damage, but melee combat being split into Attack (accuracy) and Strength (damage) for absolutely no reason.  These are totally unparsimonious design decisions, and you know what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That's fine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game did £120M in 2022, remember? People &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; it. Even making allowances for some of that revenue being driven by things like microtransactions, it's obviously a huge hit. It would probably be &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; if these things had been ironed out when it wasn't too late, but they just shipped the thing and didn't sweat all of those details too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot to be said for the broad skill of &lt;em&gt;Practicing Finishing&lt;/em&gt;, but it's probably why the ability to &lt;em&gt;Ship Something&lt;/em&gt; is valued so highly in engineering circles. Most people struggle to finish, whether it's writing a book or a piece of software, and that desire to flesh out every little flaw is frequently one of the major reasons. If they worried about all these details, they probably would have worked out that a browser game could never have lived up to their expectations, and the world would be down one huge collective experience. Some things have to be perfect, but &lt;em&gt;almost everything&lt;/em&gt; doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vi-bots"&gt;VI. Bots&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game used to be packed to the brim with strange bald men in dark green pants. They all looked exactly like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="bot.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/d1ef2d8d.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because the game was, and still is, &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; heavily botted. That is the default character. Just a million of these little guys zooming around, funneling endless piles of resources into the game's economy, mostly for the purpose of selling players in-game currency in exchange for real money. You'd frequently see them stacked up on top of each other on the exact same spot, all the lowest level, with absolute nonsense names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="bots_2.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/ed8895a3.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my first introduction to the idea of computer-assisted automation, and while I never botted myself, it was very direct exposure to the idea of an adversarial relationship existing between application developers and attackers. I suspect a great many of the people that converted the output from these bots into real-world money became the same people that try to launch attacks against our EC2 instances in an attempt to mine Ethereum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details on how the Runescape team tackles botting are very hazy, but I know enough to understand that they have developed a fairly high level of sophistication in-house, probably aided by the massive volumes of training data from the number of bots around. But it really is battling something like a serious criminal enterprise - it is not uncommon for accounts with paid memberships to get stolen through third-party database leaks. I &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; get phishing emails every so often trying to get ahold of an account I haven't touch in ten years. It's hard to know exactly how much money changes hands, but given that the people involved seem to have some level of technical ability and real money is involved, I am guessing that at least one person has genuinely been assassinated in developing countries over disrupting the bald men chopping down trees in the fantasy game, which is a fucking &lt;em&gt;insane&lt;/em&gt; sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is largely why I was extremely paranoid from day one when I heard about the concept of compromising a machine to mine cryptocurrency. I had firsthand experience &lt;em&gt;watching&lt;/em&gt; people exploit holes in systems to accumulate tiny amounts of money en masse. If there is a way to get $0.00000001 out of a system programatically, some guy is going to work out how to do it enough times to buy himself a car in the best case or a yacht in the worst case, but it'll be your money either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vii-efficiencyscape-and-money"&gt;VII. EfficiencyScape and Money&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was brought to my attention a few years ago that Jagex had lifted any restrictions on "multiplaying", i.e, the act of logging into multiple accounts at the same time. My recollection is that this was disallowed when I used to play, as the idea was that it was unfair for one player to gather resources at several times the officially allowed rate. In fact, I believe it was &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; forbidden to even trade between your own accounts when I used to play - another life lesson was sometimes asking a friend to serve as a mule between two of your accounts, and their child-brains being overwhelmed at holding all your money, whereupon they would just decide to keep it and they'd never speak to you again. I can't remember if I ever &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; this to anyone, but I learn towards imagining I did and vowing to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be that guy again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now not unusual to see people logging into &lt;em&gt;several&lt;/em&gt; paid accounts at the same time, which could cost anywhere between $30 to $100 a month depending on how many characters you're juggling at the same time. The Youtubers I've seen who still play the game make frequent reference to playing more than one character at a time as if this is totally normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose the first thing that's whacky is seeing that people are so hellbent on maximizing their efficiency that they're literally willing to pay to play multiple instance of the same game &lt;em&gt;simultaneously&lt;/em&gt;. But you know, power to them, whatnot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the broader observation is that I can only assume this has been done because it allows the developers to earn way more money per player than they otherwise would, and I figure this must coincide with their numerous acquisitions over the years. It's sad to see, but I suppose people with millions of dollars to throw around don't acquire companies because they're passionate about the game, they do it because someone convinced them that the customers can be tapped for more money under new management. The suits involved probably don't even really understand the game, and instead get a vague rundown which fails to capture any nuance, entirely focused on the number of recurring subscriptions the product has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has manifested in a few astonishing blunders, such as a widely anticipated complete graphical overhaul being &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/runelite-hd-shut-down/"&gt;banned&lt;/a&gt; because the parent company was considering working on their own graphical overhaul at some undefined date in the distant future, which was eventually walked back in the face of massive protests. Things like this happen a lot in the gaming community, such as &lt;a href="https://press-start.com.au/news/playstation/2024/05/06/sony-is-walking-back-helldivers-2s-controversial-account-changes/"&gt;Sony getting absolutely owned&lt;/a&gt; over their decision to force Helldivers 2 players to have a PSN account, and the absolute nerds over at Wizards of the Coast &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/dungeons-and-dragons-has-walked-back-its-huge-ogl-mistake-but-the-damage-is-already-done/"&gt;getting obliterated&lt;/a&gt; over trying to make modifications to Dungeons and Dragons' famous Open Gaming License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favourite thing about the last is that Matt Mercer, who has done a huge amount for Dungeon and Dragons' profile over the past few years, seems to have taken the opportunity to create his own game, &lt;a href="https://www.daggerheart.com/"&gt;Daggerheart&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn't seem that interesting on first glance &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; it's crazy that some executive that didn't understand the community has decided to roll the dice on existential risk to a &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; profitable piece of IP. People &lt;em&gt;really, really&lt;/em&gt; want their games to be more like Matt Mercer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, behaviour like this shouldn't be terribly surprising from a company that sometimes supports &lt;a href="https://runescape.wiki/w/Squeal_of_Fortune"&gt;microtransactions and in-game gambling&lt;/a&gt;, but it's astonishing how &lt;em&gt;incompetently&lt;/em&gt; it was executed. To quote The Dark Knight, this city deserves a better class of criminal. But then again, maybe we should be grateful that the blast radius is limited by all the incompetents involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="viii-all-the-good-stuff"&gt;VIII. All The Good Stuff&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's clearly some dystopian commentary to be made on adults grinding out hundreds of hours clicking on rocks for levels in a game, but there's a bunch of entirely wholesome stuff to come out of the game too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing, it certainly cheered me up on many, many days as a kid when I was having a miserable time at school, and I have no idea how I'd have managed without that little bit of escapism. I must concede sadly that the new version of the game, where people use tick manipulation with knives and logs and axes to train two skills may not scratch that itch, but the original version of the game was something to behold. It's the only reason that I know that bronze is an alloy of copper and tin, that the end of an arrow is called fletching, and a thousand other little facts. And when I was deep in burnout&lt;sup id="fnref:8"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, I somehow ended up watching challenge playthrough from Jeporite where &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQahsBowqYk"&gt;he tries to play the entire game while restricted to a tiny section of the map&lt;/a&gt;, and it &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; got me through some rough times despite being absolutely stupid as a concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The soundtrack is phenomenal and varied, and they've gone so far as to re-record some of the original MIDI soundtracks with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLWTiPLelYc"&gt;an actual orchestra&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, it still absolutely slaps, although I have no idea what it sounds like to someone didn't condition themselves on it for hundreds of hours when their brains were still developing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More broadly, I look back on the game as a spectacular, varied, imperfect work of passion. It has gone through so, so many iterations, ranging from the original DeviousMUD&lt;sup id="fnref:7"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="devious_mud.png" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/5d3c9938.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the way to the latest iteration. If there's any doubt about that, just take a look at the world map used for the above version of the game:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="original_map.jpg" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/aea15480.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This little hand-drawn map is &lt;em&gt;brimming&lt;/em&gt; with the energy which made the game the massive success that it is, which enraptured hundreds of thousands of kids across the world, and it is perhaps not terribly surprising that men and women in suits have trouble understanding that. I mean, &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; at it. It's dreadful, yet it is absolutely a better sales pitch for the game than any number of professional designers without any soul in the game can produce, which is why Runescape is a huge success and a dozen other MMOs with bigger budgets disappear every year. That core of passion is still baked in there, right next to the freehand square labelled 'Haunted House' with no additional context. The game &lt;em&gt;oozes&lt;/em&gt; it. There's a whole feature where you can manually grind wheat in a windmill to create flour so that you can bake bread, an extremely slow and stupid process that basically &lt;em&gt;no one ever uses&lt;/em&gt; because bread is worthless level one garbage, but it's in there because it sounded fun to the original developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some of the developers there are the most &lt;em&gt;beloved&lt;/em&gt; figures I've seen in any online community. &lt;em&gt;OSRS&lt;/em&gt; has one person in particular, known as Mod Ash, who has been around since the very early days, and it is not an exaggeration to say that Mod Ash leaving the company on bad terms poses an &lt;em&gt;existential threat&lt;/em&gt; to the business. If he were to get hired by a competing product and fully endorse it, many players might flock away, because his absolute commitment to the game and community over the years is considered to be beyond question at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe he's the product manager for the game these days. Punching his name into YouTube yields &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPOY0hB7c-E"&gt;"How Mod Ash Became The World's Favorite Developer"&lt;/a&gt;. The comments say things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish Ash knew how much he meant to us. I truly hope he does.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I flew to Runefest from Sweden all alone just to get a picture with him. He is the Legend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; seen people talk about a &lt;em&gt;product manager&lt;/em&gt; that way? I know this community, they're usually &lt;em&gt;feral ghouls&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Get on his fucking level&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do write quite a lot on doing meaningful work, but it's interesting to think about what that actually looks like. It's easy to imagine working on cancer cures, but compared to producing PowerBI reports, many things are valuable. They just need to align with a passion you have, once your other financial needs are both met and, ideally, minimized. For someone like Mod Ash, that's evidently treating one video game in the most soulful way a person can manage. Maybe the most important obligation that we have is simply to &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; publish a game built off the map we doodled, or indeed, to write a blog post about a game from your childhood, or to otherwise do the thing that you know you want to but are holding back from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will McAskill once said, in defense of Effective Altruism, that the world can basically absorb infinite amounts of money and continue improving outcomes linearly - that is, two mosquito nets is twice as good as one mosquito net for a &lt;em&gt;very, very large&lt;/em&gt; value of mosquito notes, but this is not true of buying yourself expensive cars. Whatever your feelings on the EA movement, that seems to be fairly obviously true. Similarly, I suspect that the world as it is has a &lt;em&gt;limitless&lt;/em&gt; capacity to absorb authenticity and keep producing better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was going to sign off with the observation that one of the game's original founders, Andrew Gower, has had a mystery company that has had no output despite existing for &lt;em&gt;fourteen years&lt;/em&gt;, and I was going to use it as an example of how extreme talent or vision doesn't lend itself to a repeat success. But it turns out that since I last looked last year, he announced what looks to be (essentially) &lt;a href="https://www.brightershores.com/"&gt;Runescape 4, or Brighter Shores&lt;/a&gt;, presumably produced with the millions of pounds he got from the original acquisition but while retaining complete creative control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I going to play it? &lt;em&gt;Probably not&lt;/em&gt;, I think (sadly) the period of my life where my imagination ran so wild that I could be enraptured by pixels and MIDI soundtracks has run its course, and I'm busy these days. Busy with things I love for the most part, yes, but there's something bittersweet in not having the time to love more things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I'm glad that those mad bastards might let another generation of kids have the opportunity to let their imaginations run wild, and (lamentably but necessarily) get scammed. My accommodation during this trip to Fiji is right next to a school, and I can hear that generation right now, screaming at the top of their lungs and kicking a ball around the schoolyard while their teachers desperately try to keep them under control. Godspeed, you snot-nosed monsters, and I hope you have as much fun as I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was still young enough that when I thought of &lt;em&gt;cool&lt;/em&gt;, my brain went straight for &lt;em&gt;favourite Pokemon&lt;/em&gt;. Note that it was not Charizard, because I am not basic.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I'm also being extremely biased.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who has always given off powerful casual misogynist vibes, and I've been more recently informed he has gone "full cult mode", whatever that means. I.e, I do not endorse the author broadly.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, there's the casual misogyny already! What a speedrun, great work team!&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I've never been able to make myself read Simon Sinek despite all the recommendations - has he led anything &lt;em&gt;other than his own marketing team?&lt;/em&gt; Because if he hasn't, we really shouldn't listen to anything he says, we should just start mimicking exactly what he does to make ourselves famous!&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:6"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like &lt;a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/02/blockchain_and_.html"&gt;Bruce Schneier's writing on this&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:6" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:7"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, I found an even &lt;em&gt;older&lt;/em&gt; iteration of the game while writing this.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:7" title="Jump back to footnote 7 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:8"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is a topic for another day, but it was &lt;em&gt;miserable&lt;/em&gt;, and wholesome, nostalgic entertainment was very important for my brain.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:8" title="Jump back to footnote 8 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
